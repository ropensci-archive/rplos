\arguments{
\item{q}{Search terms (character). You can search on specific fields by
doing 'field:your query'. For example, a real query on a specific field would
be 'author:Smith'.}

\item{fl}{Fields to return from search (character) [e.g., 'id,title'],
any combination of search fields (see the dataset \code{plosfields})}

\item{fq}{List specific fields to filter the query on (if NA, all queried).
The options for this parameter are the same as those for the fl parameter.
Note that using this parameter doesn't influence the actual query, but is used
to filter the results to a subset of those you want returned. For example,
if you want full articles only, you can do \code{'doc_type:full'}. In another example,
if you want only results from the journal PLOS One, you can do
\code{'journal_key:PLoSONE'}. See \code{\link{journalnamekey}} for journal
abbreviations.}

\item{sort}{Sort results according to a particular field, and specify ascending (asc)
or descending (desc) after a space; see examples. For example, to sort the
counter_total_all field in descending fashion, do sort='counter_total_all desc'}

\item{start}{Record to start at (used in combination with limit when
you need to cycle through more results than the max allowed=1000). See Pagination
below}

\item{limit}{Number of results to return (integer). Setting \code{limit=0} returns only
metadata. See Pagination below}

\item{sleep}{Number of seconds to wait between requests. No need to use this for
a single call to searchplos. However, if you are using searchplos in a loop or
lapply type call, do sleep parameter is used to prevent your IP address from being
blocked. You can only do 10 requests per minute, so one request every 6 seconds is
about right.}

\item{errors}{(character) One of simple or complete. Simple gives http code and
error message on an error, while complete gives both http code and error message,
and stack trace, if available.}

\item{proxy}{List of arguments for a proxy connection, including one or more of:
url, port, username, password, and auth. See \code{\link[crul]{proxy}} for
help, which is used to construct the proxy connection.}

\item{callopts}{(list) optional curl options passed to \code{\link[crul]{HttpClient}}}

\item{progress}{a function with logic for printing a progress
bar for an HTTP request, ultimately passed down to \pkg{curl}.
only supports \code{httr::progress()}}

\item{...}{Additional Solr arguments}
}
\value{
Abstract content, in addition to any other fields requested in a list.

\section{Faceting}{

\section{Website vs. API behavior}{

Don't be surprised if queries you perform in a scripting language, like using \code{rplos}
in R, give different results than when searching for articles on the PLOS website. I am
not sure what exact defaults they use on their website. There are a few things to consider.
You can tweak which types of articles are returned: Try using the \code{article_type}
filter in the \code{fq} parameter. For which journal to search, e.g., do
\code{'journal_key:PLoSONE'}. See \code{journalnamekey()} for journal
abbreviations.
}

\section{Phrase searching}{

To search phrases, e.g., \strong{synthetic biology} as a single item, rather than
separate occurrences of \strong{synthetic} and \strong{biology}, simply put double
quotes around the phrase. For example, to search for cases of \strong{synthetic biology},
do \code{searchplos(q = '"synthetic biology"')}.

You can modify phrase searches as well. For example,
\code{searchplos(q = '"synthetic biology" ~ 10')} asks for cases of
\strong{synthetic biology} within 10 words of each other. See examples.
}

\section{Pagination}{

The \code{searchplos} function and the many functions that are wrappers around 
\code{searchplos} all do paginatino internally for you. That is, if you request for 
example, 2000 results, the max you can get in any one request is 1000, so we'll do 
two requests for you. And so on for larger requests. 

You can always do your own paginatino by doing a lapply type call or a for loop 
to cycle through pages of results.
