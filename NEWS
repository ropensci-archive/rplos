rplos 0.1.0
------------

* The `almdateupdated` function has been deprecated - use `almupdated` instead.

* The `articlelength` function has been deprecated - didn't see the usefulness any longer.

* In general simplified and prettified code.

* Changed from using RCurl to httr in many functions, but not all.

* Added more examples for many functions.

* Added three internal functions: `concat_todf`, `addmissing`, and `getkey`.

* Added Karthik Ram as a package author.

BUG FIXES

* All `url` arguments in functions put inside functions as they are not likely to change that often.

* Fixed `crossref` function, and added more examples.

NEW FEATURES

* The `alm` function (previously `almplosallviews`) gains many new features: now allows up to 50 DOIs per call; you can specify the source you want to get alm data from as an argument; you can specify the year you want to get alm data from as an argument.

* Added the plosfields data file to get all the possible fields to use in function calls.


NEW FUNCTIONS

* `almplosallviews` changed to `alm`.

* `almplotallviews` changed to `almplot`.

* `almevents` added to specifically search and get detailed events data for a specific source or N sources. 

* `crossref_r` gets 20 random DOIs from Crossref.org.

* Added package startup message.

* `journalnamekey` function to get the short name keys for each PLoS Journal.

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* ALM functions (any functions starting with alm) received updated arguments/parameters according to the ALM API version 3.0 changes. 

* Bug fixes in general across library. 

* Added tests.

* `almplosallviews` now outputs different output - two data.frames, one total metrics (summed across time), and history (for metrics for each time period specified in the search)

* `crossref` function returns R's native bibtype format.  See examples in `crossref` function documentation

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* changed help file `rplos` to `help` - use help('rplos') in R

* changed URL from http://ropensci.org/ to https://github.com/ropensci/rplos

* added sleep argument to `plosallviews` function to allow pauses between API calls when running `plosallviews` in a loop - this is an attempt to limit hitting the PLoS API too hard

* various other fixed to functions
