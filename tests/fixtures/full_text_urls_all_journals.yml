        <abstract>
        <p>There is much debate on the dietary adaptations of the robust hominin lineages during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition. It has been argued that the shift from C3 to C4 ecosystems in Africa was the main factor responsible for the robust dental and facial anatomical adaptations of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> taxa, which might be indicative of the consumption of fibrous, abrasive plant foods in open environments. However, occlusal dental microwear data fail to provide evidence of such dietary adaptations and are not consistent with isotopic evidence that supports greater C4 food intake for the robust clades than for the gracile australopithecines. We provide evidence from buccal dental microwear data that supports softer dietary habits than expected for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> based both on masticatory apomorphies and isotopic analyses. On one hand, striation densities on the buccal enamel surfaces of paranthropines teeth are low, resembling those of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> and clearly differing from those observed on <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, which display higher scratch densities indicative of the consumption of a wide assortment of highly abrasive foodstuffs. Buccal dental microwear patterns are consistent with those previously described for occlusal enamel surfaces, suggesting that <italic>Paranthropus</italic> consumed much softer diets than previously presumed and thus calling into question a strict interpretation of isotopic evidence. On the other hand, the significantly high buccal scratch densities observed in the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> specimens are not consistent with a highly specialized, mostly carnivorous diet; instead, they support the consumption of a wide range of highly abrasive food items.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The emergence of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> and <italic>Homo</italic> lineages in East Africa has been linked to an ecological shift toward C4 grasslands between 2.4 and 1.8 million years ago (Ma) caused by a marked global cooling and drying that resulted in contrasted year-round seasons and a variety of ecological scenarios with great spatial heterogeneity and ecological instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref006">6</xref>]. Remains of both <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic> and early <italic>Homo</italic> have been associated with both well-watered, riverine habitats with gallery forest and woodlands in older localities and with extensive dry grasslands with episodes of lake fluctuations or, more recently, deltaic conditions. This habitat shift is assumed to have forced hominines to adopt a more intense exploitation of savanna plant foods, including underground storage organs (USOs). The robust australopithecines would have relied on dental and facial morphological adaptations to cope with long-term environmental challenges, whereas the generalized use of lithic tools would have offered early <italic>Homo</italic> greater opportunities to exploit food resources in highly variable environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref010">10</xref>]. The massive mandibular corpus, extended muscle insertion areas on the skull, large occlusal molar surfaces, premolar molarization, and thick enamel layers in <italic>Paranthropus</italic> are consistent with consumption of hard foodstuffs involving strong cracking, crushing, and grinding activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref014">14</xref>]. Tooth chipping and massive occlusal wear on the postcanine dentition of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> are indicative of peak bite forces and frequent chewing of small, hard food abrasives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref016">16</xref>]. However, occlusal dental microwear analyses of <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic> teeth fail to reveal any evidence of hard object feeding and contrast with isotopic evidence supporting a diet based above 70% on C4 plants such as fibrous grasses, sedges, or rhizomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref020">20</xref>]. Many fallback foods are mechanically challenging, which may explain the high occlusal wear of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref021">21</xref>], while the reduced dental and facial proportions in early <italic>Homo</italic> have been interpreted as indicative of meat exploitation as a major food source, mainly through scavenging strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref024">24</xref>] to offset the dearth of succulent food resources in open environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref026">26</xref>]. Numerous studies have emphasized the importance of meat consumption in the large brained, small-toothed hominines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref029">29</xref>]. However, the reduction in tooth size would have potentially limited the types of foods available to <italic>Homo ergaster</italic>. In contrast, in <italic>Homo habilis</italic>, the dental reduction that characterizes more recent humans was not fully attained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
        <p>Dental microwear patterns, both on buccal and occlusal enamel surfaces, have proved to be highly informative of foraging strategies in extant primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref035">35</xref>]. Early analyses of occlusal microwear patterns on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>africanus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>robustus</italic> suggested that "the diet <italic>of Paranthropus</italic> entailed the mastication of harder items than composed the dietary staples <italic>of Australopithecus</italic>", similar to those of primates that eat large quantities of hard objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref037">37</xref>]. In contrast, more recent analyses of occlusal enamel texture suggested that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> might not have consumed extremely hard or tough foods in the days prior to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>] and that it might have consumed foods “with similar ranges of toughness as those eaten by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>africanus</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref019">19</xref>]. Early <italic>Homo</italic> would not have relied on extremely hard or tough foods such as nuts, USOs or dried meat, whereas <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> would have consumed more fracture-resistant food items (USOs or tough animal tissues) than <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref038">38</xref>]. The two <italic>Homo</italic> species would have differed in fallback food consumption during stress periods, consistent with the climate change towards open savannas over time, with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> relying on stone tools for processing fallback foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
        <p>Dietary hypotheses based on occlusal dental microwear research can be tested by buccal dental microwear patterns analyses. Buccal dental microwear is characterized by numerous striations with varying orientations and the lack of other wear features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref044">44</xref>], such as pits or inter-tooth attrition that are common on occlusal enamel surfaces. Occlusal microwear patterns vary between shearing and grinding facets on the same tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref045">45</xref>] and intra-facet variability within molar teeth has been shown to depend on varying mastication processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref046">46</xref>]. Occlusal dental microwear is highly affected by dental gross wear, because dentine exposure and enamel cracking quickly wear away the Phase II molar facets upon which most occlusal microwear research is based. In addition, forceful tooth-to-tooth contact and dental grinding are non-dietary sources of microwear features (both pits and scratches) on occlusal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref047">47</xref>]. In contrast, buccal microwear is not affected by occlusal wear and dentine exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref048">48</xref>] and has been shown to have a clearly distinct <italic>in vivo</italic> feature formation dynamics, and is likely to have a longer formation span than occlusal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref051">51</xref>]. Buccal microwear is the result of the interaction of abrasive particles, such as plant phytoliths or silica dust, with the buccal enamel surfaces of teeth during chewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref053">53</xref>], as food particles move around in the mouth (mainly in an up-to-down and front-to-back direction) until they are swallowed.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that post-depositional, taphonomic processes do not add new microwear features; instead, they obliterate and erase them, significantly damaging enamel surfaces, as shown by experimental analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref055">55</xref>], which makes <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage clearly distinguishable from <italic>ante-mortem</italic> diet-related microwear patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref057">57</xref>]. The presence of pits on the buccal surfaces and of microwear features on inter-proximal wear facets is a clear indicator of <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
        <p>Buccal microwear patterns in humans have been shown to be age-dependent in archeological collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>] and in Middle and Upper Pleistocene fossil specimens, especially in juvenile individuals with definitive, fully functional dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref059">59</xref>]. However, the intra-population variability of buccal microwear patterns has been shown to be smaller than the inter-population variability in adult individuals of hunter-gatherer populations from different ecological areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref053">53</xref>]. Buccal microwear patterns analysis is a replicable procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref060">60</xref>] and has been shown to be highly dependent on ecological constraints and dietary preferences in both extant and fossil primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref033">33</xref>] and in fossil hominins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>]. Consequently, buccal microwear research is informative of diet composition and on the amount of abrasives incorporated to foodstuffs during food processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
        <p>In the present research, scratch densities and average lengths by orientation categories on well-preserved teeth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> (early <italic>Homo</italic>), and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> specimens are studied. Their buccal microwear patterns are compared to those of extant primate samples from both closed forests and open woodlands and to those of the previously studied hominins <italic>Australopithecus anamensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>] and <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>] specimens. The main goals are to test the contradictory interpretations derived from anatomical traits, occlusal microwear patterns and texture data, and isotopic evidence for the robust australopithecines from East Africa and to determine the significance of a carnivorous diet in the <italic>Homo</italic> clade.</p>

        <title>Samples studied</title>
        <p>A total of 446 postcanine teeth were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165447.t001">Table 1</xref>), belonging to 167 fossil specimens of <italic>Paranthropus aethiopicus</italic> (N = 44), <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic> (N = 56), <italic>Homo habilis</italic> (early <italic>Homo</italic>) (N = 49) and <italic>Homo ergaster</italic> (N = 18) from East African sites dating from 2.5 to 1.4 Ma, including Omo and Hadar in Ethiopia, Koobi Fora, West Turkana, Lake Baringo, and Lainyamok in Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge and Peninj in Tanzania. All necessary permits were obtained for the described study from the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), the Kenyan National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI), and the Nairobi National Museum, which complied with all relevant regulations. The studied samples included the same specimens for which occlusal dental microwear and texture patterns have been previously studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref068">68</xref>]. Dental molds were made from the original fossil specimens curated at the National Museums of Ethiopia (Addis-Ababa), Kenya (Nairobi) and Tanzania (Dar es Salaam and Arusha). Taxonomic attributions of hominin specimens were obtained from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref075">75</xref>]. However, there is no full consensus concerning the taxonomic attribution of some early <italic>Homo</italic> specimens to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic>, <italic>Homo rudolfensis</italic>, or <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref076">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref078">78</xref>]. In the present study, a broad <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> group was considered for all East African early <italic>Homo</italic> specimens dating between 1.7 and 1.4 Ma. No specimens from the Shungura and Koobi Fora formations, ascribed to the <italic>Homo rudolfensis</italic> clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref080">80</xref>], showed well-preserved buccal enamel surfaces, as was also the case for the occlusal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref038">38</xref>]; therefore, the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>rudolfensis</italic> taxon was not considered. Due to the unresolved controversy concerning the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> hypodigm from Olduvai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref068">68</xref>], the Olduvai sample was considered as a single species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref069">69</xref>]. The well-preserved <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> sample (N = 10) included seven specimens from Olduvai (OH 13, OH 16, OH 21, OH 27, OH 41, OH 62, and OH 69), one from Hadar (AL 666–1) and two from Omo (L 984 and 75s-69-14a) that have been considered as early <italic>Homo</italic> specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref080">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref081">81</xref>]. The <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> group included well-preserved specimens from Koobi Fora (ER 820, ER 992, ER 807, and ER 806), Olduvai (OH 23), and Nachukui (WT 15000).

The well-preserved specimens of this group included <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> from West Turkana (WT 16005 and WT 17000) and Omo (L238-35, L338X-35, L62-17, and L860-2) and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> from Koobi Fora (ER 1509, ER 1804, and ER 5431), Olduvai (OH 5 and OH 66), Nachukui (WT 17400 and WT 18600), Ileret (ER 729), Omo (L 7a-125), and Peninj (W64-160). The buccal microwear patterns of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>] (N = 5) and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>] (N = 26), as well as Cercopithecoidea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref035">35</xref>] (N = 80) and Hominoidea primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref033">33</xref>] (N = 48), were used for comparative purposes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165447.t001">Table 1</xref>).

        <p>Dietary habits greatly vary among the comparative primate samples studied. Geladas (<italic>Theropithecus gelada</italic>) are found in the high grassland of the deep gorges of the central Ethiopian plateau. They are the only primates that are primarily graminivores and grazers (grass blades make up to 90% of their diet). When both blades and seeds are available, geladas prefer the seeds, though they also eat flowers, rhizomes and roots when available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref085">85</xref>]. Mandrills (<italic>Mandrillus sphinx</italic>) live in tropical rainforests and in gallery forests adjacent to savannas, as well as rocky forests, riparian forests, cultivated areas and flooded forests and streambeds. Forest-dwelling mandrills mostly feed (over 70% year-round) on mechanically protected plant foods such as hard-shell fruits or seeds from the ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref087">87</xref>], but will also eat leaves, lianas, bark, stems, and fibers; it also consumes mushrooms and soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref088">88</xref>]. The olive baboon (<italic>Papio anubis</italic>) is usually classified as savanna-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands, especially those near open woodland, but it also inhabits rainforests and deserts. The diet typically includes a large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, as well as birds. The olive baboons eat leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, and mushrooms, as well as corms and rhizomes that are especially important in times of drought. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref089">89</xref>]. The main habitat of the vervet monkeys (<italic>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</italic>) is savanna woodlands. Its feeding habits consist of eating mostly fruits, vegetables, and small mammals, insects, and birds, making it an omnivore. The vervets needs to live around a source of water, especially during the dry season, and is able to adapt to many environments consuming a great variety of foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref090">90</xref>]. The blue monkey (<italic>Cercopithecus mitis</italic>) is found in evergreen forests, and lives largely in the forest canopy, coming to the ground infrequently. It is very dependent on humid, shady areas with plenty of water. They are primarily frugivores, with 50% of their diet consisting of fruit, with leaves or insects as their main source of protein, with the rest of the diet being made up of seeds, flowers, and fungi. They eat a variety of plants, but concentrate on a few species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref091">91</xref>]. The collared mangabeys (<italic>Cercocebus torquatus</italic>) are found in coastal, swamp, mangrove, and valley forests. It has a diet based of fruits (60%) and seeds (20%), but also eats leaves, foliage, flowers, invertebrates, mushrooms, dung, and gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref092">92</xref>]. They have thick enamel to process hard-object foods as a fallback feeding strategy, such as bark or seeds, when preferred foods (fruits) are unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref093">93</xref>]. The Colobus monkeys (<italic>Colobus sp</italic>.) are arboreal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref094">94</xref>], traditionally classified as a genuine leaf-eaters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref095">95</xref>], but are considered to have a heterogeneous diet, including fruit, flowers, and twigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref096">96</xref>]. Their habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands. Their ruminant-like digestive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref097">97</xref>] have enabled these leaf-eaters to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref098">98</xref>]. Finally, within the hominoidea primates, the western lowland gorillas (<italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic>) live in primary and secondary rain forests and lowland swamps in central Africa. They eat a combination of fruits and foliage depending on the time of year. When ripe fruit is available, they tend to eat more fruit as opposed to foliage. When ripe fruit is in scarce supply, they eat leaves, herbs, and bark. Gorillas choose fruit that is high in sugar for energy, as well as fiber, and in the dry season they still continue to eat other kinds of fruits, and they may also eat insects from time to time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref099">99</xref>]. The Grauer’s gorilla (<italic>Gorilla beringei graueri</italic>) is endemic to the mountainous and lowland forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. They prefer fruits, but when scarce they increase the consumption of leaves, pith, and barks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref100">100</xref>]. The common chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) lives in a variety of habitats, including dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic. It is an omnivorous that prefers fruit above all other food items and even seeks out and eats them when they are not abundant. It also eats leaves and leaf buds, as well as seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark and resin. Insects and meat make up a small proportion of their diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref101">101</xref>].</p>

        <p>Taphonomy may severely limit available samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>]. The fossil teeth analyzed showed considerable <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g001">Fig 1</xref>) that included chipping, surface erosion, etching, and weathering patterns, similar to that previously described for Olduvai and Hadar specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref102">102</xref>]. The damage was initially attributed to the consumption of acidic foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref104">104</xref>] but was later thought more likely to be related to <italic>post-mortem</italic> wear affecting the entire tooth dental crown, including the inter-proximal wear facets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref058">58</xref>]. <italic>Post-mortem</italic> damage was also observed on the occlusal surfaces of the same specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref040">40</xref>]. The East African fossil specimens unearthed at ancient paleo-lakes and fluvial areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref105">105</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref107">107</xref>] were probably damaged by prolonged surface exposure or by water transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref038">38</xref>]. Such circumstances are likely to be responsible for most of the <italic>post-mortem</italic> abrasions observed, and such abrasions were also present in some unworn, not-fully functional teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref102">102</xref>]. The well-preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g002">Fig 2</xref>) samples consisted of 66 teeth (14.8% of the 446 teeth studied) belonging to 36 hominin specimens.

        <p>The methods for sample selection followed standard procedures in buccal microwear research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>]. A single tooth, showing a well-preserved buccal enamel patch, was chosen to represent each individual. The lower M<sub>1</sub>, either left or right, was preferentially selected when available because it is the first tooth to erupt. Otherwise, P<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, or M<sub>3</sub> were selected (in that order) in preference to the upper dentition. Consequently, the final studied sample included 33 specimens from the 66 well-preserved teeth belonging to the four hominine species studied: 7 <italic>Paranthropus aethiopicus</italic>, 10 <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic>, 10 <italic>Homo habilis</italic>, and 6 <italic>Homo ergaster</italic>, as well as 3 undetermined <italic>Homo sp</italic>. specimens from Koobi Fora (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0165447.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Dental casts and scanning electronic microscopy observations</title>
        <p>Dental crown molds were made with President MicroSystem Regular Body (Coltène<sup>™</sup>) polyvinyl siloxane following standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref110">110</xref>]. Positive casts were made with epoxy resin or polyurethane (Epotek 301 Epoxy Technologies, Inc. Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's indications. All casts were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter-coated with a 40 Å gold layer. Prior to scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) examinations, all replicas were observed under a binocular light microscope at 10–30× magnification. The replicas that exhibited clear <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref102">102</xref>], such as multiple parallel scratches, enamel chipping or enamel prisms exposure, both at low magnification or under SEM observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>], were discarded to prevent non-dietary related factors from affecting the buccal microwear pattern analysis.</p>
        <p>Well-preserved buccal enamel surfaces were digitized under SEM at the <italic>Centres Científicos i Tecnològics</italic> (CCiT) of the Universitat de Barcelona, at 100× magnification, 18–25 mm working distance (WD), and 15 kV acceleration voltage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref112">112</xref>]. Slight variations in WD did not affect the measurements of the microwear features because all analyzed images were cropped to exactly cover 0.56 mm<sup>2</sup> (748.33 × 748.33 μm) of enamel surface, the standard dimensions used in SEM buccal microwear studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>], and all image measurements were scaled prior to analysis. During scanning, the buccal enamel surface of each tooth crown was placed perpendicular to the electron beam, with the occlusal crown rim facing upwards in all SEM images. The digital images were taken in the middle third of the crown, avoiding both the occlusal and cervical thirds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref042">42</xref>]. A high-pass (50-pixel) filter and the automatic grey levels adjustment command in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe<sup>™</sup>) were applied to all cropped digital grey-scale images to reduce shadows and enhance image contrast.</p>

        <title>Analysis of buccal microwear patterns</title>
        <p>In the selected micrographs, the length (in μm) and orientation angle (with respect to the horizontal occlusal plane) of all observed scratches within the studied enamel patch (including those cropped by the observation area) were measured using a semi-automatic procedure with SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (SPSS<sup>™</sup>) software. All scratches measuring less than 10 μm in length (approximately 4 times the average width) were not considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref042">42</xref>]. Following standard procedures in buccal microwear research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>], measures of the density of scratches (N) and their average length (X) were obtained for all the observed striations by four 45°-degree orientation categories −vertical (V), horizontal (H), mesio-occlusal to disto-cervical (MD), and disto-occlusal to mesio-cervical (DM)−, as well as for the total number of striations observed (T) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> section). Consequently, a total of 10 variables were derived for each tooth studied (NV, XV, NH, XH, NMD, XMD, NDM, XDM, NT, XT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s001">S1 Table</xref>), so that the interpopulation differences could be referred to specific striation densities and lengths by orientations categories. While all the studied variables exhibited normal distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, P &gt; 0.05) for all the hominin groups considered (Early <italic>Homo</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>), rank-transformed variables were used for the inter-group comparison analyses because sample sizes were small and differed greatly among groups, as well as bevause.</p>
        <p>Inter-observer error is a major concern in microwear research both for the occlusal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref062">62</xref>] and buccal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref063">63</xref>] enamel surfaces. Therefore, a single observer (LMM) measured all the micrographs of the fossil hominins studied, as well as of the <italic>Theropithecus</italic> specimens used for comparison. However, the primate comparative samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref113">113</xref>] and the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>] were measured by different researchers (JG and FE, respectively). Nonetheless, the inter-observer error analyses among all the researchers involved in this study have not shown significant differences in the buccal microwear patterns measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
        <p>Comparisons of buccal microwear patterns among the hominin groups studied were made with a multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) and <italic>post-hoc</italic> pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction of <italic>P</italic>-values. The variability in the dispersion of buccal microwear patterns among these hominin groups and among the hominines and the comparative samples are illustrated with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) plots of the first two discriminant functions obtained (DF1 <italic>vs</italic>. DF2), using the species as the independent variable to determine if species with similar microwear patterns show similar diets or share similar environmental conditions. A Cluster Analysis (CA) of the group centroids was derived from the diagonal matric of Fisher's distances among the groups obtained in the CVA. All the statistical analyses and group comparisons were made using PAST v. 3.10 statistical package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref114">114</xref>] and XLSTAT v. 2015 (Addinsoft).</p>

        <p>The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the four hominin groups studied (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic>, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>) was able to correctly classify 51.5% of all cases, although that ability diminishes to only 24.2% after jack-knife cross-validation. The first two discriminant functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g004">Fig 4</xref>) explain 93.8% of the total variance (55.9% DF1 and 37.9 DF2). DF1 shows negative loadings for NMD (−35.8), NH (−21.7) and NV (−7.3) and positive loadings for XH (11.7), XDM (10.0), XMD (6.9), and XV (3.4), as well as for NDM (5.4), which behaves differently in this respect than NMD. DF2 shows negative loadings with all the density variables (mainly with NDM, −17.4), as well as with XMD (−4.0), and shows positive loadings with all the length variables (mainly with XV, 25.8, and XDM, 22.6). Despite the four groups greatly overlap, <italic>Homo ergaster</italic> specimens show negative values for DF1 that reflect their higher striation densities compared to the other taxa. A <italic>post-hoc</italic> classification of the ungrouped <italic>Homo</italic> sp. specimens (ER-1814, ER-3734 and ER-6128) within the LDA showed that their buccal microwear pattern is most similar to that of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic>, with a 100% <italic>post hoc</italic> classification probability in all three cases.</p>

        <p>The second discriminant analysis, including all the comparative samples, expands the microwear pattern diversity observed in the LDA of hominines alone. The multiple MANOVA test within the LDA clearly shows significant among-group differences (Wilks' lambda = 0.133, F = 3.3454, P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s002">S2 Table</xref>), and the <italic>post hoc</italic> pairwise comparisons using Fisher's distance (d<sub>F</sub>) between groups show significant differences between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> and the two <italic>Paranthropus</italic> taxa (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> d<sub>F</sub> = 2.755, P = 0.007; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> d<sub>F</sub> = 2.272, P = 0.025), but not between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> and the paranthropines (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> d<sub>F</sub> = 1.067, P = 0.388; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> (d<sub>F</sub> = 1.794, P = 0.081). Significant differences were also found between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> (d<sub>F</sub> = 2.775, P = 0.006), though not between <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> (d<sub>F</sub> = 0.431, P = 0.902). The four hominines could be significantly discriminated from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic>, while <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> was the only group that did not significantly differed from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> (d<sub>F</sub> = 1.533, P = 0.149). The univariate among-groups comparisons (ANOVAs) were significant (P&lt;0.03) for all the variables studied except XDM (F = 1.016, P = 0.441; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s003">S3 Table</xref>). The scatterplot of DF1 vs. DF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g005">Fig 5</xref>) explains 73,66% of the total variance (57,25% and 16,41%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s004">S4 Table</xref>), and 46,73% of the 199 specimens were correctly classified, a value that diminished to 31.16% after jack-knife cross-validation. DF1 was highly correlated with NV (r = 0.922) and NMD (r = 0.494), whereas DF2 was correlated with NDM (r = 0.706), NH (r = 0.663), XH (r = −0.359), and XMD (r = −0.214) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s005">S5 Table</xref>). Only 46.73% of all cases were correctly classified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s006">S6 Table</xref>) and this figure decreased to 31.16% after jack-knife cross-validation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s007">S7 Table</xref>). The hominin taxon with the highest posterior classification probability before validation is <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> (60,0%), followed by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> (50,0%), <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> (16.7%), and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> (14.3%). In fact, the two paranthropines greatly overlap in the LDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and 64.3% are correctly classified into a robust taxon. The <italic>Homo habilis</italic> specimens overlap with the paranthropines for both DF1 and DF2, whereas <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> shows a distinct distribution along both DF1 and DF2, overlapping with the hominoidea primates and with <italic>Colobus</italic>. As has already been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref043">43</xref>], <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> specimens more closely resemble the cercopithecoidea primates, especially <italic>Papio anubis</italic> and <italic>Theropithecus gelada</italic>, in having high striation densities, mainly the vertical ones (NV), with the exception of <italic>Colobus</italic> that has a smaller striation density that overlaps for DF1 with the hominoids, likely due to its mainly folivorous diet compared to the other cercopithecoidea taxa studied that consume greater amounts of hard foods, especially, seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref033">33</xref>]. The largest numbers of vertical striations (NV) are observed in <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> (108.8), followed by <italic>Papio</italic> (85.8), <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> (81.0), <italic>Theropithecus</italic> (79.0), <italic>Mandrillus</italic> (60.3), and <italic>Cercocebus</italic> (45.7), with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> showing a NV value (68.0) well within the range of these cercopithecoidea samples. Despite the diet of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>mitis</italic> is mainly composed of fruits, this species showed the highest density of vertical striations (NV) and one of the highest total striation densities (NT = 244.0) observed, along with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>torquatus</italic> (NT = 249.3), which suggests that they might have also relied on harder items, perhaps as fallback foods. The hominoidea primates considered show significantly lesser NV values (53.3 <italic>G</italic>. <italic>gorilla gorilla</italic>, 44.3 <italic>G</italic>. <italic>beringei graueri</italic>, and 40.4 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>troglodytes</italic>) that overlap with that of <italic>Cercocebus</italic> (45.7). <italic>Colobus</italic> (35.6) shows a NV values similar to that of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> (28.3), while the other hominins studied show significantly smaller values (28.8 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, 21.8 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>, 21.6 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic>, and 17.6 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic>). Within the cercopithecoidea, the highest values of NDM are observed in <italic>Cercocebus</italic> (84.3) and <italic>Mandrillus</italic> (53.0), and the lowest is seen in <italic>Papio</italic> (20.4). However, the cercopithecoidea and hominoidea greatly overlap for DF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165447.g005">Fig 5</xref>). <italic>Theropithecus</italic> has been proposed as a model for interpreting the diet of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref084">84</xref>]. However, its overall average striation density (NT = 176.7) is much higher than those of both <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> (94.9) and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> (105.9) −in fact these are the smallest average striation densities observed in all the samples studied−, and both hominins significantly differ from the primate taxon (d<sub>F</sub> = 4.434, P&lt;0.0001 for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic>; d<sub>F</sub> = 4.249, P = 0.000 for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>), despite the fact that their habitats might not have differed greatly from those occupied by contemporaneous <italic>Theropithecus</italic>.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Phytoliths require some 6,000 mega-Pascal (MPa; 6,000 mega-Pascal = 6,000 Newton/mm<sup>2</sup>) of force per unit area to deform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref115">115</xref>]. It has been suggested that enamel can be scratched at about half that force (3,700 MPa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref116">116</xref>]. Based on this estimate, it has been argued that the forces applied to food on the buccal side of a tooth may not be sufficient to scratch enamel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>], indicating that it is "merely a matter of believe" that as food matter is masticated the abrasive particles scratch the buccal enamel surfaces (page 290 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>]). However, more recent estimates suggests that the critical loads required to fracture enamel in humans exceed 500 Newtons (N), whereas the loads required to produce individual microwear traces are in the order of milli-Newtons (mN), less than 1 N per unit area (&lt;1 MPa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref117">117</xref>] −much less that previously suggested 3,700 MPa. Whatever the case, our experimental analyses on modern human volunteers have clearly shown that striations on buccal enamel surfaces are in fact formed as a result of food chewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref049">49</xref>], despite the buccal side of the tooth is not involved in tooth-to-tooth contact during food processing. Experimental analyses have shown not only that buccal enamel scratching is possible, but also that despite scratch formation rates on buccal surfaces are faster than expected, buccal microwear patterns can be used as long-term proxy for inferring dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref051">51</xref>]. Furthermore, buccal microwear patterns have been shown to significantly discriminate among dietary habits of living hunter-gatherer pygmy populations from western central Africa with varying degrees of hunting and gathering practices, as well as from agricultural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref063">63</xref>]. Despite these evidences, buccal microwear incidence has also been suggested to be "most likely related to differences in the frequency of terrestrial feeding events" in relation to the "opportunity to ingest exogenous grit" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>]. However, the volunteers in our experimental buccal microwear analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref063">63</xref>] are not likely to be consumers of grit and dust. In addition, complex behaviors, such as the possibility that hominins could have cleaned dirty food before consuming it, with or without stone tools, should not be disregarded. An occlusal-limited view of attritional processes disregards the fact that the energy of a particle depends not only on the forces applied on occlusal surfaces, either involving no particle movement (causing pits) or slight and angular displacement (causing scratches). It also depends on the mechanical energy attributable to particles, especially their speed, while moving between the cheek and the buccal enamel surfaces of teeth during food chewing. As has been acknowledged, the precise causes of microwear formation are difficult to "pin down" and involve mechanics that are more complex than imagined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref118">118</xref>]. More specific research on enamel etching, analyzing both forces and particle speed, are yet required.</p>
        <p>In addition, attempts to associate buccal microwear patterns of fossil hominins to post-depositional, taphonomic processes should also be valid for occlusal enamel surfaces. There is no reason to disregard well-preserved, <italic>ante-mortem</italic> microwear signals, either on buccal or occlusal dental surfaces, since those microwear features have been observed on live modern humans, as well as primates. It is germane to note that taphonomic processes affect both buccal and occlusal enamel surfaces and that <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage can be properly dealt with in both cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref102">102</xref>].</p>
        <p>Occlusal enamel microwear SEM or texture data are available for most African hominin species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref119">119</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref120">120</xref>], whereas buccal microwear data for the same specimens is yet scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>]. Consistent dietary interpretations of both occlusal and buccal enamel surfaces analyses have been obtained for <italic>Australopithecus anamensis</italic> specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref120">120</xref>], whereas contrasting results have been shown for <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic> fossil specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref119">119</xref>]. The occlusal microwear pattern of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> have suggested that <italic>Gorilla</italic> and/or <italic>Theropithecus</italic> constitute the best modern analogues for dietary preference of this species, and that there is no occlusal microwear evidence of the mastication of hard, brittle items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref118">118</xref>]. The buccal microwear pattern of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> has shown resemblances in striation densities, although not in striation lengths, to those of <italic>Gorilla</italic> and <italic>Pan</italic>, which are clearly distinct from those of cercopitecoid primates from more open environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref066">66</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> specimens show a distinct buccal microwear pattern that significantly differs from those of most of the cercopitecoids species studied (except <italic>Colobus</italic>), including <italic>Theropithecus</italic> that was not available in our previous analyses. The buccal microwear patterns of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> and <italic>Theropithecus</italic> significantly differ (d<sub>F</sub> = 4.712, P&lt;0.0001), which suggests that the diet of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>afarensis</italic> was not heavily dependent on grasses or seeds. It would have rather consumed greater amounts of less abrasive foods, such as fruits and foliage, since its buccal microwear pattern more closely resemble that of the hominoids that those observed in the cercopitecoids. By contrast, <italic>Australopithecus anamensis</italic>, characterized by a high density of vertical scratches, greatly overlaps with <italic>Theropithecus</italic> in the CVA and the two taxa do not significantly differ (d<sub>F</sub> = 1.192, P = 0.307). Our analysis supports that the diet of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic> would have significantly relied on seeds and grasses from open woodlands, in addition to fruits from more closed environments, as we have previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
        <p>Fossil specimens of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> have shown high carbon isotope ratios (δC<sup>13</sup>) suggestive of a significant consumption of C4 or/and CAM plant foods (≥ 50%)—clearly higher (with specimen WT-17000 being an outlier) than those shown by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>anamensis</italic>, which would have preferred C3-rich diets with low percentages of C4 plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref121">121</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref123">123</xref>]. Nevertheless, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> shows the lowest overall density of buccal scratches, with WT-17000 showing the highest striation density compared to the other six specimens of the same taxon (see raw data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165447.s001">S1 Table</xref>). <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic> specimens have also shown high C4 isotopic signals, ranging from 75% to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref121">121</xref>]. However, their buccal microwear patterns do not support an abrasive diet based on hard, tough, or fibrous C4 plant foods, a result concordant with that obtained on occlusal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref019">19</xref>]. In contrast, the significance of CAM plants such as the succulent xerophytes, which would be less abrasive but result in greater C4 signals, is difficult to disentangle. The significant C4 signal of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> could also be due to secondary C4-based diet from animal foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref124">124</xref>] or to consumption of aquatic resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref125">125</xref>], which is supported by the δO<sup>18</sup> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref017">17</xref>]. The buccal microwear patterns of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> do not support the hypothesis of consumption of highly abrasive or tough foodstuffs, in contrast to the assumption that their distinct cranio-dental adaptations are indicative of highly abrasive food intake, mostly USOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref126">126</xref>]. The robust facial and dental anatomy of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> might reflect the occlusal biomechanics of food processing (such as peak loads, repeated loadings, and tooth-food-tooth contact while chewing) as the cause of enamel fracture rather than the chewing of abrasive foods. The preparation and ingestion of large, fracture-inducing food objects such as nuts and seeds might result in distinct, high-density occlusal microwear signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref127">127</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref128">128</xref>]. In contrast, buccal microwear patterns might depend more on the particle movements during the chewing cycle rather than on food cutting, cracking, or grinding with dental occlusal surfaces. Low cheek-to-tooth loadings and the kinetics of abrasive particles in the mouth, along with the amount of chewed abrasives, sufficiently explain scratch formation on buccal enamel surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref049">49</xref>]. Thus, buccal microwear is more indicative of food properties than occlusal microwear, which is also dependent on the mechanics of the chewing cycle. Biomechanically challenging USOs (underground storage organs) such as corms, seeds, or bulbs could lead to isotopic signals that would match the low microwear feature densities observed in <italic>Paranthropus boisei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref129">129</xref>]. Moreover, C4 resources capable of causing high densities of microwear features remain to be found in East Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref130">130</xref>].</p>
        <p>A durophage-ecotone trophic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref124">124</xref>] for the robust australopithecines would be consistent with the buccal microwear patterns, morphological adaptations, and isotopic indicators. If <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> did not consume highly abrasive diets, its robust dental morphology and thick enamel could have developed as adaptations to consumption of hard-shelled invertebrate prey such as crabs, similar to those present in animals such as marsh mongoose (<italic>Atilax</italic>) or Cape clawless otter (<italic>Aonyx</italic>) that live in riverine or lake environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref131">131</xref>]. A durophage-ecotone model for the robust australopithecines was suggested to provide a clear mechanism, based on habitat and trophic preferences, to explain the long-term coexistence of <italic>Paranthropus</italic> and early <italic>Homo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref124">124</xref>]. A durophage dietary hypothesis for the paranthropines would also be consistent with the observed microwear results, the morphological adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref111">111</xref>], and the isotopic indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref132">132</xref>]). However, it has been questioned whether <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei’s</italic> dental traits would have evolved as an adaptation to a diet specialized on freshwater crabs. Grine <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>] argued that otters would not serve as a model for hard-object feeding in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>robustus</italic> due to its thin enamel. Moreover, there are concerns about the viability of a diet specialized in freshwater resources. Ancient hominin species lived near freshwater springs, rivers, lakes or estuaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref133">133</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref137">137</xref>], which has led several authors to speculate that access to freshwater from endorheic lakes of the East African Rift System (EARS) would have been vital for hominin survival and expansion during the Pliocene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref134">134</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref138">138</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref140">140</xref>]. However, many of these lakes would have been saline during the Pliocene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref140">140</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref141">141</xref>]. It may seem unlikely that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic> would have been a crab-specialist in a highly dispersed resource landscape if the productivity of the freshwater lakes would not have been sufficient to maintain the large populations of crabs needed to feed a highly specialized crab-consuming hominin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref133">133</xref>]. However, consumption of fresh water crabs might have been a sporadic, or even a fallback resource for the paranthropines.</p>
        <p>Early <italic>Homo</italic> specimens have shown isotopic signals mainly indicative of C3 plant consumption (45−65%) with an increase in C4 resource consumption of more than 20% over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref122">122</xref>], which is consistent with the observed increase in buccal microwear striation densities from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>. On one hand, early <italic>Homo</italic> specimens show low scratch densities suggestive of chewing soft foods, consistent with meat consumption as a major dietary source and increased brain volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref142">142</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> specimens show higher and more variable striation densities, suggestive of consumption of a wider range of hard and/or tough items than early <italic>Homo</italic> and consistent with an ecological diversification of the <italic>Homo</italic> clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref143">143</xref>]. Although more research is needed to clarify the question of the synchrony of two, or even three, <italic>Homo</italic> species, the distinct buccal microwear signals observed in early <italic>Homo</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> specimens suggest a clear temporal trend in food exploitation strategies that might be related to increasing dependence on mechanically demanding USOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref129">129</xref>]. An efficient exploitation of a wide range of high-quality fallback foods might have required complex behavioral adaptations, including the use of tools for food processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref039">39</xref>]. The evolved Acheulian lithic industry linked to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> might have provided the opportunity and flexibility required to differentially exploit a variety of fallback resources, although it might have not significantly reduced the amount of abrasive particles in foodstuffs. Climatic fluctuations in East Africa approximately 1.8 Ma and the aridity peak coincident with the emergence of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref003">3</xref>] might explain its highly abrasive buccal microwear signal, which is indicative of a more abrasive diet in this taxon than in early <italic>Homo</italic>—a finding that is in line with an omnivorous diet including plant foods with silica particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref040">40</xref>] that are abundant in East African open and arid environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref144">144</xref>]. This does not rule out the hypothesis of meat as an important food source, but dependence on plant foods would have been at least of similar importance as that described for modern hunter-gatherer populations from arid environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref129">129</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref145">145</xref>]. Despite the occlusal crown relief suggesting that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> would have heavily relied on fallback resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref146">146</xref>], the buccal microwear patterns suggest that early <italic>Homo</italic> might have ingested fewer abrasives than <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, which may have depended on harder and tougher fallback foods. Differences in the exploitation of ecological niches by the two species may explain the buccal microwear differences observed: wooded, gallery forest with softer foods rich in sugars by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>habilis</italic> and open savannas with abrasive food items by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, irrespective of the amount of meat they consumed.</p>
        <p>Finally, differences in temporal scales of dietary proxies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref147">147</xref>] might be relevant to explain the lack of concordance of dietary interpretations, especially between isotope data, indicative of dietary practices during the time of dental crown development, and occlusal microwear and texture data, largely affected by the "last-supper" effect. Carbon and oxygen isotopes are incorporated into the teeth during the formation and mineralization of the enamel (from a few months to two years). The dietary signal is therefore averaged over that time period and for the time that enamel becomes fully mineralized. Thus, the enamel might not reflect the animal's diet right before death. In contrast, the rate of formation of microwear features on occlusal surfaces is so fast that microwear patterns and texture measures might be reflecting the diet consumed only a few days before death, which has been referred to as the "Last Supper Effect". Despite microwear traces of diet might be somewhat ephemeral on occlusal surfaces, one can decipher the actual dietary habits of an individual at a given point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref018">18</xref>]. However, buccal microwear patterns might be informative of a longer span of dietary-related activities. The rates of newly formed features per week may increase from about 3% in normal <italic>ad-libitum</italic> diets to 9% when dried meat or fish are consumed, or to 22% when stone-ground flower is consumed. In the short span of about 5 weeks of this experimental design, there was no loss of microwear features. However, in the long-term experiments, no significant increase through time () was observed in the striation densities, and the average net long-term turn over rate on buccal enamel surfaces was −0.009 scratches/week. This suggests a stasis in microwear patterns depending on dietary habits or ecological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165447.ref049">49</xref>]. Although buccal microwear patterns might average a longer period of dietary habits than occlusal microwear patterns, they are more likely to show concordant results than if compared to carbon isotopic stages if the diets of infant and adults hominins differed.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Patterns of buccal dental microwear striation densities and lengths are consistent with enamel microwear complexity and anisotropy on occlusal dental surfaces previously described for East African Lower Pleistocene <italic>Paranthropus</italic> specimens. Our results do not support the dietary interpretations based on 13C stable isotopic ratios that suggest a significant consumption of C4 plant foods in open environments. Quite the contrary, the buccal microwear patterns suggest that the dietary habits of both <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aethiopicus</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boisei</italic>, unlike early <italic>Homo</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ergaster</italic>, did not involve chewing significant amounts of abrasive foods. Alternatively, consumption of non-abrasive, though brittle, C4-rich resources would be consistent with both occlusal and buccal microwear patterns, isotopic data, and anatomical adaptations in the paranthropine clade.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Despite the rapid adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops by farmers in many countries, public controversies about the risks and benefits continue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Gilbert1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Andreasen1">[4]</xref>. Numerous independent science academies and regulatory bodies have reviewed the evidence about risks, concluding that commercialized GM crops are safe for human consumption and the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-DeFrancesco1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-European1">[7]</xref>. There are also plenty of studies showing that GM crops cause benefits in terms of higher yields and cost savings in agricultural production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Pray1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Sexton1">[12]</xref>, and welfare gains among adopting farm households <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Ali1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim2">[15]</xref>. However, some argue that the evidence about impacts is mixed and that studies showing large benefits may have problems with the data and methods used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Stone1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Glover1">[18]</xref>. Uncertainty about GM crop impacts is one reason for the widespread public suspicion towards this technology. We have carried out a meta-analysis that may help to consolidate the evidence.</p>
        <p>While earlier reviews of GM crop impacts exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim3">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Areal1">[22]</xref>, our approach adds to the knowledge in two important ways. First, we include more recent studies into the meta-analysis. In the emerging literature on GM crop impacts, new studies are published continuously, broadening the geographical area covered, the methods used, and the type of outcome variables considered. For instance, in addition to other impacts we analyze effects of GM crop adoption on pesticide quantity, which previous meta-analyses could not because of the limited number of observations for this particular outcome variable. Second, we go beyond average impacts and use meta-regressions to explain impact heterogeneity and test for possible biases.</p>
        <p>Our meta-analysis concentrates on the most important GM crops, including herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybean, maize, and cotton, as well as insect-resistant (IR) maize and cotton. For these crops, a sufficiently large number of original impact studies have been published to estimate meaningful average effect sizes. We estimate mean impacts of GM crop adoption on crop yield, pesticide quantity, pesticide cost, total production cost, and farmer profit. Furthermore, we analyze several factors that may influence outcomes, such as geographic location, modified crop trait, and type of data and methods used in the original studies.</p>

        <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Literature search</title>
        <p>Original studies for inclusion in this meta-analysis were identified through keyword searches in relevant literature databanks. Studies were searched in the ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, EconLit, and AgEcon Search. We searched for studies in the English language that were published after 1995. We did not extend the review to earlier years, because the commercial adoption of GM crops started only in the mid-1990s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-James1">[23]</xref>. The search was performed for combinations of keywords related to GM technology and related to the outcome of interest. Concrete keywords used related to GM technology were (an asterisk is a replacement for any ending of the respective term; quotation marks indicate that the term was used as a whole, not each word alone): GM*, “genetically engineered”, “genetically modified”, transgenic, “agricultural biotechnology”, HT, “herbicide tolerant”, Roundup, Bt, “insect resistant”. Concrete keywords used related to outcome variables were: impact*, effect*, benefit*, yield*, economic*, income*, cost*, soci*, pesticide*, herbicide*, insecticide*, productivity*, margin*, profit*. The search was completed in March 2014.</p>
        <p>Most of the publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge are articles in academic journals, while Google Scholar, EconLit, and AgEcon Search also comprise book chapters and grey literature such as conference papers, working papers, and reports in institutional series. Articles published in academic journals have usually passed a rigorous peer-review process. Most papers presented at academic conferences have also passed a peer-review process, which is often less strict than that of good journals though. Some of the other publications are peer reviewed, while many are not. Some of the working papers and reports are published by research institutes or government organizations, while others are NGO publications. Unlike previous reviews of GM crop impacts, we did not limit the sample to peer-reviewed studies but included all publications for two reasons. First, a clear-cut distinction between studies with and without peer review is not always possible, especially when dealing with papers that were not published in a journal or presented at an academic conference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Rothstein1">[24]</xref>. Second, studies without peer review also influence the public and policy debate on GM crops; ignoring them completely would be short-sighted.</p>
        <p>Of the studies identified through the keyword searches, not all reported original impact results. We classified studies by screening titles, abstracts, and full texts. Studies had to fulfill the following criteria to be included:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet"><list-item>
        <p>The study is an empirical investigation of the agronomic and/or economic impacts of GM soybean, GM maize, or GM cotton using micro-level data from individual plots and/or farms. Other GM crops such as GM rapeseed, GM sugarbeet, and GM papaya were commercialized in selected countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-James1">[23]</xref>, but the number of impact studies available for these other crops is very small.</p>
        </list-item><list-item>
        <p>The study reports GM crop impacts in terms of one or more of the following outcome variables: yield, pesticide quantity (especially insecticides and herbicides), pesticide costs, total variable costs, gross margins, farmer profits. If only the number of pesticide sprays was reported, this was used as a proxy for pesticide quantity.</p>
        </list-item><list-item>
        <p>The study analyzes the performance of GM crops by either reporting mean outcomes for GM and non-GM, absolute or percentage differences, or estimated coefficients of regression models that can be used to calculate percentage differences between GM and non-GM crops.</p>
        </list-item><list-item>
        <p>The study contains original results and is not only a review of previous studies.</p>
        </list-item></list>
        <p>In some cases, the same results were reported in different publications; in these cases, only one of the publications was included to avoid double counting. On the other hand, several publications involve more than one impact observation, even for a single outcome variable, for instance when reporting results for different geographical regions or derived with different methods (e.g., comparison of mean outcomes of GM and non-GM crops plus regression model estimates). In those cases, all observations were included. Moreover, the same primary dataset was sometimes used for different publications without reporting identical results (e.g., analysis of different outcome variables, different waves of panel data, use of different methods). Hence, the number of impact observations in our sample is larger than the number of publications and primary datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s007">Data S1</xref>). The number of studies selected at various stages is shown in the flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111629-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The number of publications finally included in the meta-analysis is 147 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effect sizes and influencing factors</title>
        <p>Effect sizes are measures of outcome variables. We chose the percentage difference between GM and non-GM crops for five different outcome variables, namely yield, pesticide quantity, pesticide cost, total production cost, and farmer profits per unit area. Most studies that analyze production costs focus on variable costs, which are the costs primarily affected through GM technology adoption. Accordingly, profits are calculated as revenues minus variable production costs (profits calculated in this way are also referred to as gross margins). These production costs also take into account the higher prices charged by private companies for GM seeds. Hence, the percentage differences in profits considered here are net economic benefits for farmers using GM technology. Percentage differences, when not reported in the original studies, were calculated from mean value comparisons between GM and non-GM or from estimated regression coefficients.</p>
        <p>Since we look at different types of GM technologies (different modified traits) that are used in different countries and regions, we do not expect that effect sizes are homogenous across studies. Hence, our approach of combining effect sizes corresponds to a random-effects model in meta-analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Borenstein1">[25]</xref>. To explain impact heterogeneity and test for possible biases, we also compiled data on a number of study descriptors that may influence the reported effect sizes. These influencing factors include information on the type of GM technology (modified trait), the region studied, the type of data and method used, the source of funding, and the type of publication. All influencing factors are defined as dummy variables. The exact definition of these dummy variables is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t001">Table 1</xref>. Variable distributions of the study descriptors are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s005">Table S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>In a first step, we estimate average effect sizes for each outcome variable. To test whether these mean impacts are significantly different from zero, we regress each outcome variable on a constant with cluster correction of standard errors by primary dataset. Thus, the test for significance is valid also when observations from the same dataset are correlated. We estimate average effect sizes for all GM crops combined. However, we expect that the results may differ by modified trait, so that we also analyze mean effects for HT crops and IR crops separately.</p>
        <p>Meta-analyses often weight impact estimates by their variances; estimates with low variance are considered more reliable and receive a higher weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Shadish1">[26]</xref>. In our case, several of the original studies do not report measures of variance, so that weighting by variance is not possible. Alternatively, weighting by sample size is common, but sample sizes are also not reported in all studies considered, especially not in some of the grey literature publications. To test the robustness of the results, we employ a different weighting procedure, using the inverse of the number of impact observations per dataset as weights.

        <p>On average, GM technology has increased crop yields by 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111629-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These yield increases are not due to higher genetic yield potential, but to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim4">[27]</xref>. At the same time, GM crops have reduced pesticide quantity by 37% and pesticide cost by 39%. The effect on the cost of production is not significant. GM seeds are more expensive than non-GM seeds, but the additional seed costs are compensated through savings in chemical and mechanical pest control. Average profit gains for GM-adopting farmers are 69%.</p>

        <p>Results of Cochran’s test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Borenstein1">[25]</xref>, which are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s001">Figure S1</xref>, confirm that there is significant heterogeneity across study observations for all five outcome variables. Hence it is useful to further disaggregate the results. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t002">Table 2</xref> shows a breakdown by modified crop trait. While significant reductions in pesticide costs are observed for both HT and IR crops, only IR crops cause a consistent reduction in pesticide quantity. Such disparities are expected, because the two technologies are quite different. IR crops protect themselves against certain insect pests, so that spraying can be reduced. HT crops, on the other hand, are not protected against pests but against a broad-spectrum chemical herbicide (mostly glyphosate), use of which facilitates weed control. While HT crops have reduced herbicide quantity in some situations, they have contributed to increases in the use of broad-spectrum herbicides elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-FernandezCornejo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim3">[19]</xref>. The savings in pesticide costs for HT crops in spite of higher quantities can be explained by the fact that broad-spectrum herbicides are often much cheaper than the selective herbicides that were used before. The average farmer profit effect for HT crops is large and positive, but not statistically significant because of considerable variation and a relatively small number of observations for this outcome variable.</p>

        <p>Most original studies in this meta-analysis build on farm surveys, although some are based on field-trial data. Field-trial results are often criticized to overestimate impacts, because farmers may not be able to replicate experimental conditions. However, results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t003">Table 3</xref> (column 1) show that field-trial data do not overestimate the yield effects of GM crops. Reported yield gains from field trials are even lower than those from farm surveys. This is plausible, because pest damage in non-GM crops is often more severe in farmers’ fields than on well-managed experimental plots.</p>
        <p>Another concern often voiced in the public debate is that studies funded by industry money might report inflated benefits. Our results show that the source of funding does not significantly influence the impact estimates. We also analyzed whether the statistical method plays a role. Many of the earlier studies just compared yields of GM and non-GM crops without considering possible differences in other inputs and conditions that may also affect the outcome. Net impacts of GM technology can be estimated with regression-based production function models that control for other factors. Interestingly, results derived from regression analysis report higher average yield effects.</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined whether the type of publication matters. Controlling for other factors, the regression coefficient for journal publications in column (1) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t003">Table 3</xref> implies that studies published in peer-reviewed journals show 12 percentage points higher yield gains than studies published elsewhere. Indeed, when only including observations from studies that were published in journals, the mean effect size is larger than if all observations are included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s002">Figure S2</xref>). On first sight, one might suspect publication bias, meaning that only studies that report substantial effects are accepted for publication in a journal. A common way to assess possible publication bias in meta-analysis is through funnel plots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Borenstein1">[25]</xref>, which we show in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111629.s003">Figure S3</xref>. However, in our case these funnel plots should not be over-interpreted. First, only studies that report variance measures can be included in the funnel plots, which holds true only for a subset of the original studies used here. Second, even if there were publication bias, our mean results would be estimated correctly, because we do include studies that were not published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
        <p>Further analysis suggests that the journal review process does not systematically filter out studies with small effect sizes. The journal articles in the sample report a wide range of yield effects, even including negative estimates in some cases. Moreover, when combining journal articles with papers presented at academic conferences, average yield gains are even higher (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t003">Table 3</xref>, column 2). Studies that were neither published in a journal nor presented at an academic conference encompass a diverse set of papers, including reports by NGOs and outspoken biotechnology critics. These reports show lower GM yield effects on average, but not all meet common scientific standards. Hence, rather than indicating publication bias, the positive and significant journal coefficient may be the result of a negative NGO bias in some of the grey literature.</p>
        <p>Concerning other outcome variables, IR crops have much stronger reducing effects on pesticide quantity than HT crops (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111629-t003">Table 3</xref>, column 3), as already discussed above. In terms of pesticide costs, the difference between IR and HT is less pronounced and not statistically significant (column 4). The profit gains of GM crops are 60 percentage points higher in developing countries than in developed countries (column 6). This large difference is due to higher GM yield gains and stronger pesticide cost savings in developing countries. Moreover, most GM crops are not patented in developing countries, so that GM seed prices are lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111629-Qaim3">[19]</xref>. Like for yields, studies published in peer-reviewed journals report higher profit gains than studies published elsewhere, but again we do not find evidence of publication bias (column 7).</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>This meta-analysis confirms that – in spite of impact heterogeneity – the average agronomic and economic benefits of GM crops are large and significant. Impacts vary especially by modified crop trait and geographic region. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for IR crops than for HT crops. Yield and farmer profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Recent impact studies used better data and methods than earlier studies, but these improvements in study design did not reduce the estimates of GM crop advantages. Rather, NGO reports and other publications without scientific peer review seem to bias the impact estimates downward. But even with such biased estimates included, mean effects remain sizeable.</p>
        <p>One limitation is that not all of the original studies included in this meta-analysis reported sample sizes and measures of variance. This is not untypical for analyses in the social sciences, especially when studies from the grey literature are also included. Future impact studies with primary data should follow more standardized reporting procedures. Nevertheless, our findings reveal that there is robust evidence of GM crop benefits. Such evidence may help to gradually increase public trust in this promising technology.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern, whereby the ecological relatedness of host-associated microbial communities parallels the phylogeny of related host species. Here, we test the prevalence of phylosymbiosis and its functional significance under highly controlled conditions by characterizing the microbiota of 24 animal species from four different groups (<italic>Peromyscus</italic> deer mice, <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, mosquitoes, and <italic>Nasonia</italic> wasps), and we reevaluate the phylosymbiotic relationships of seven species of wild hominids. We demonstrate three key findings. First, intraspecific microbiota variation is consistently less than interspecific microbiota variation, and microbiota-based models predict host species origin with high accuracy across the dataset. Interestingly, the age of host clade divergence positively associates with the degree of microbial community distinguishability between species within the host clades, spanning recent host speciation events (~1 million y ago) to more distantly related host genera (~108 million y ago). Second, topological congruence analyses of each group's complete phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram reveal significant degrees of phylosymbiosis, irrespective of host clade age or taxonomy. Third, consistent with selection on host–microbiota interactions driving phylosymbiosis, there are survival and performance reductions when interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between closely related and divergent host species pairs. Overall, these findings indicate that the composition and functional effects of an animal's microbial community can be closely allied with host evolution, even across wide-ranging timescales and diverse animal systems reared under controlled conditions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Studies on the assembly and function of host-microbiota symbioses are inherently complicated by the diverse effects of diet, age, sex, host genetics, and endosymbionts. Central to unraveling one effect from the other is an experimental framework that reduces confounders. Using common rearing conditions across four animal groups (deer mice, flies, mosquitoes, and wasps) that span recent host speciation events to more distantly related host genera, this study tests whether microbial community assembly is generally random with respect to host relatedness or "phylosymbiotic," in which the phylogeny of the host group is congruent with ecological relationships of their microbial communities. Across all four animal groups and one external dataset of great apes, we apply several statistics for analyzing congruencies and demonstrate phylosymbiosis to varying degrees in each group. Moreover, consistent with selection on host–microbiota interactions driving phylosymbiosis, transplanting interspecific microbial communities in mice significantly decreased their ability to digest food. Similarly, wasps that received transplants of microbial communities from different wasp species had lower survival than those given their own microbiota. Overall, this experimental and statistical framework shows how microbial community assembly and functionality across related species can be linked to animal evolution, health, and survival.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>A large body of literature has documented genetic and environmental influences on the composition of host-associated microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref010">10</xref>]. Although environmental factors are considered to play a much larger role than host genetics and evolutionary history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref011">11</xref>], host influences and their functional consequences are poorly elucidated and thus require systematic study across host–microbiota systems. Several outstanding questions remain regarding the nature of host effects on microbiota assembly. Are host–microbiota associations stochastically assembled, or might there be deterministic assembly mechanisms that predict these associations? How rapidly do microbiota differences form between closely related host species, and are interspecific microbiota differences prone to decay over evolutionary time? Can host-driven assembly of the microbiota be isolated from confounding variables such as diet, age, sex, and endosymbionts? If there are microbiota differences between species, are they functional in an evolutionarily informed manner, such that mismatches between host and interspecific microbiota lead to reductions in fitness or performance, particularly when interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between older host species pairs?</p>
        <p>If host-associated microbial communities assemble stochastically through environmental acquisition with no host-specific influence, then microbiota compositions across related host species will not differ from expectations based on random community assemblies and dispersal limitations. Therefore, in a common environment, microbiota will form independent of host species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and any interspecific differences in microbiota composition would be arbitrary. In contrast, if hosts influence a sufficient amount of the composition of the microbiota, then under controlled rearing conditions, intraspecific microbial communities will structure more similarly to each other than to interspecific microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Similarly, if microbial communities are randomly established or are not distinguishable with regard to host evolutionary relationships, then dendrograms illustrating beta diversity distance relationships between microbial communities will not parallel the phylogeny of the host species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, if microbial communities are distinguishable, then hosts with greater genetic divergence may exhibit more distinguishable microbiota. In this case, there will be congruence between the host phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). As this outcome is not likely due to coevolution, cospeciation, or cocladogenesis of the entire microbial community from a last common ancestor, "phylosymbiosis" was proposed as a new term that does not necessarily presume that members of the microbial community are constant, stable, or vertically transmitted from generation to generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref012">12</xref>]. Rather, phylosymbiosis refers to an eco-evolutionary pattern in which evolutionary changes in the host associate with ecological changes in the microbiota.</p>

        <p>Phylosymbiosis leads to the explicit prediction that as host nuclear genetic differences increase over time, the differences in host-associated microbial communities will also increase. Indeed, phylosymbiosis has been observed in natural populations of sponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref013">13</xref>], ants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref010">10</xref>], bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref014">14</xref>], and apes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref016">16</xref>]. However, other studies on termites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref017">17</xref>], flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref020">20</xref>], birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref021">21</xref>], and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref022">22</xref>] have not observed strict patterns of phylosymbiosis or host-specific microbial signatures. In natural population studies, determining the forces driving phylosymbiosis is equivocal, as both environmental and host effects can covary and contribute to microbiota assembly. Importantly, major effects of the environment, age, or sex may overwhelm the ability to detect phylosymbiosis. Indeed, diet is a stronger determinant of whole microbial community structure than genotype in lab-bred mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref023">23</xref>]. Additionally, conjecture about the formation of host-specific communities should be resolved in a wider context, especially their functional significance, as microbiotas may be inconsequential to host biology or uniquely situated for certain host genotypes and fitness. Thus, the prevalence and functional significance of phylosymbiosis is uncertain and requires reductionist approaches to discriminate among the frequently confounded variables of host, environment, development, sex, and even endosymbiont status.</p>
        <p>Here, we quantify phylosymbiosis under laboratory conditions to control for environmental and host rearing variation. Prior investigations of phylosymbiosis have not typically controlled for these confounding variables, with the exception of male <italic>Nasonia</italic> wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref002">2</xref>] and <italic>Hydra</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref024">24</xref>]. Specifically, we reared 24 species in the laboratory while controlling for sex (virgin females), age, diet, and endosymbionts, thus removing major environmental variables and isolating the contribution of host species on microbiota assembly. The experimental systems, or “host clades,” span four species of <italic>Nasonia</italic> parasitic jewel wasps, six species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies, eight species of <italic>Anopheles</italic>, <italic>Aedes</italic>, and <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, and six species of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> deer mice. An externally derived dataset with seven members of the hominid lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref016">16</xref>] provides another mammalian and multigenus clade for reference and facilitates examination of natural populations in which phylosymbiosis was previously documented. Together, the five host clades include 31 distinct taxa and span a range of estimated divergence times from 0.2–108 million y. Last, we test the hypothesis that phylosymbiosis represents a functional association through a series of microbial transplants with autochthonous (intraspecific) and allochthonous (interspecific) microbiota in <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Peromyscus</italic>. We expect that an experimentally mediated disruption of phylosymbiosis will have functional costs that may lower host fitness or performance in an evolutionarily informed manner. Our findings demonstrate that a consistent set of controlled experimental and bioinformatic approaches in comparative microbiota studies can isolate host-driven phylosymbiosis.</p>

        <title>Host Clade Differentiates Microbial Communities</title>
        <p>Phylosymbiosis predicts that host clades will harbor distinguishable microbial communities (e.g., jewel wasps versus fruit flies versus deer mice, etc.) and that more closely related host clades will exhibit more similar microbial communities (e.g., insects versus mammals). Indeed, at a broad scale, we found that host clades harbored relatively distinct microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, ANOSIM, R = 0.961, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e–6). Furthermore, there was significant microbiota differentiation between the mammalian and invertebrate host clades in the principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, ANOSIM, R = 0.905, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e–6). The PCoA shows insect groups separating along two dimensions of a plane, with the mammals distinguished orthogonally from that plane in a third dimension, suggesting that variance in insect microbial communities is fundamentally different than that in mammals. As is well established, the gut communities of mammals were dominated by the bacterial classes Clostridia (Firmicutes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, hominid 42%, <italic>Peromyscus</italic> 37%) and Bacteroidia (Bacteroidetes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, hominid 15%, <italic>Peromyscus</italic> 37%), while the insect clades were dominated by Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> 78%, mosquito 69%, <italic>Nasonia</italic> 77%). This same bacterial divide is also seen in the network analysis, with significant clustering of the insect microbial communities around Proteobacteria, and the mammal microbial communities around subsets of shared and unique Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (G-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e–6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Microbial diversity as measured by the Shannon index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref025">25</xref>] was approximately 35% higher in mammalian hosts compared to insects, indicating more diverse symbiont communities among the mammalian clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; Nested analysis of variance [ANOVA]: phylum effect [mammals versus insects]: F<sub>1,302</sub> = 419.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; clade effect nested within phylum: F<sub>3,298</sub> = 18.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; species effect nested within clade and phylum: F<sub>26,272</sub> = 7.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

        <p>We implemented a random forest classifier (RFC) supervised learning algorithm to quantify the degree to which individual microbial communities can be classified into their respective host clade. RFC models show a strong ability to classify microbial communities to their correct host clades based on OTUs (98.5% classification accuracy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Additionally, models distinguish mammals and insect samples with high accuracy (95.9% classification accuracy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Cross-validation prevents overfitting by ensuring that classification accuracy is assessed using only samples excluded from model training. We also used RFC models to identify the most distinguishing bacterial taxonomic level for both interclade distinction and the divide between mammals and insects. Genera provided the strongest ability to predict host clade (99.0% classification accuracy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s005">S1 Table</xref>); however, the major groups of insects and mammals were better distinguished by family-level community classification (98.3% classification accuracy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrate that evolutionary relationships of the host clades broadly covary with differences in microbial communities. While differentiation of the five clades could in part be attributable to varied experimental conditions for each animal group (since they were reared separately), clustering of the vertebrate microbial communities from the insect microbial communities is independent of rearing conditions and suggests a host-assisted structuring of microbial communities.</p>

        <title>Intraspecific Microbial Communities Are Distinguishable within Host Clades</title>
        <p>Phylosymbiosis predicts that an individual’s microbial community will exhibit higher similarity to communities of the same host species than to those from different host species. The degree of similarity can be variable but should correlate with genetic relatedness of the host species. Pairwise comparisons of beta diversity distances between all individuals within each host clade reveal that the average distance between microbial communities within a species is always less than between species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Summarized beta diversity also reveal lower intraspecific versus interspecific distances, with significant differences observed for all clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, Each dataset: Mann–Whitney U, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e–6).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We next evaluated intraspecific microbiota clustering through Bray–Curtis beta diversity interrelationships with PCoA and statistically assessed the strength of interspecific microbiota distinguishability with ANOSIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Visualization of the first three principle components revealed that individual samples clustered around their respective species’ centroid position. In all host clades, each host species harbored significantly distinguishable microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, ANOSIM <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for all host clades). Notably, the ANOSIM R-values of interspecific microbiota distinguishability within a host clade positively correlated with the maximal age of divergence of the species in the host clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, Regression Analysis Log Transformed Clade Age, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; Untransformed Clade Age, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048). Thus, host clades with higher total divergence times between species had stronger degrees of microbiota distinguishability, while less diverged host clades exhibited less microbiota distinguishability. For example, with an estimated host divergence time of 108 million y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref027">27</xref>], mosquitoes showed the greatest distinguishability of their microbiota. Conversely, in <italic>Nasonia</italic> jewel wasps, which only diverged between 200,000 and 1 million y ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref028">28</xref>], the relative strength of clustering was less distinct but still statistically significant. The three intermediate aged clades showed corresponding intermediate levels of clustering: <italic>Drosophila</italic> had an estimated divergence time of 62.9 million y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref029">29</xref>], hominids diverged 9 million y ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref030">30</xref>], and <italic>Peromyscus</italic> diverged 11.7 million y ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, the phylosymbiotic prediction that host species will exhibit significant degrees of specific microbiota assembly was supported in these observations, even under highly controlled conditions in the laboratory models. Microbiota specificity was maintained among very closely related and very divergent species, and a connection was observed between the magnitude of host genetic divergence and microbiota similarity.</p>

        <title>Supervised Classification: Microbiota Composition Predicts Host Species</title>
        <p>As microbiota clustering was supported within species across all five animal clades, it should be possible to model the strength of how well communities of bacteria predict their host species and how specific members of the microbiota affect these predictions. We therefore used RFC models trained on the microbiota of each host clade to evaluate classification accuracy (i.e., the percentage of assigning microbiota to their correct host species) and the expected predicted error (EPE, i.e., the ratio of model accuracy relative to random classification). RFC results indicated that the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and genus taxonomic levels for hominid, mosquito and <italic>Nasonia</italic> have the highest classification accuracies, with significant EPE observed for all clades (EPE &gt; 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s005">S1 Table</xref>). At the genus level, the mosquito and <italic>Drosophila</italic> host clades exhibited the strongest results (mosquito, classification accuracy = 99.8%, EPE = 558.9; <italic>Drosophila</italic>, classification accuracy = 97.2%, EPE = 31.7). Other host clades demonstrated significant but comparatively lower strength models. The reduced predictive power of these models may be due to a number of factors, such as a lower number of host species (<italic>Nasonia</italic>, classification accuracy = 88.7%, EPE = 13.4), uneven sample representation from each species (hominid, classification accuracy = 53.4%, EPE = 2.1), and lower sequencing coverage (<italic>Peromyscus</italic>, classification accuracy = 61.4%, EPE = 2.5).</p>
        <p>To determine the most distinguishing genera of the bacterial community, we examined the resulting loss of model classification accuracy when each genus was excluded from RFCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Distinguishability within the <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Nasonia</italic>, and mosquito clades was driven primarily by genera in Proteobacteria, which represent five (14.0% model accuracy), seven (11.3% model accuracy), and eight (18.2% model accuracy) of the top ten genera, respectively. Three of the ten most distinguishing genera in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females are from the Acetobacteraceae family (9.5% model accuracy), previously recognized to be “core” microbiota members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref032">32</xref>]. Three of the twenty most distinguishing genera in <italic>Nasonia</italic> females were closely related symbionts from the Enterobacteriaceae family (genera: <italic>Proteus</italic>, <italic>Providencia</italic>, <italic>Morganella</italic>; 3.1% model accuracy), consistently found in our previous studies of <italic>Nasonia</italic> males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref002">2</xref>]. Eight genera from the phylum Proteobacteria dominate mosquito female distinguishability, primarily three Gammaproteobacteria of the order Pseudomonadales (8.2% model accuracy), and three Betaproteobacteria of the family Comamonadaceae (5.9% model accuracy). Hominid interspecific distinguishability was driven by the phylum Firmicutes, particularly of the order <italic>Clostridiales</italic> that contains three of the most distinguishing genera (1.5% model accuracy). The genus <italic>Allobaculum</italic> conferred nearly double the distinguishing power of any other bacteria in <italic>Peromyscus</italic> (3.8% model accuracy), and it is associated with low-fat diet, obesity, and insulin resistance in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref033">33</xref>]. As may be expected, genera of the abundant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated the majority of distinguishability in <italic>Peromyscus</italic> (10.6% model accuracy), but genera from Proteobacteria in the family Helicobacteraceae comprised four of the top eleven genera (4.4% model accuracy). Overall, microbiota composition can be used to predict host species with high accuracy, and genera commonly observed in other studies of these host clades underlie interspecific distinguishability.</p>

        <title>Phylosymbiosis Is Common within Host Clades</title>
        <p>The major prediction of phylosymbiosis is that phylogenetic relatedness will correlate with beta diversity relationships of microbial communities among related host species. Microbiota dendrograms were constructed by collapsing individual samples to generate an aggregate microbial community for each species and then by comparing relationships of their beta diversity metrics. The matching cluster and Robinson–Foulds tree metrics were utilized to calculate host phylogenetic and microbiota dendrogram topological similarity, with normalized distances ranging from 0.0 (complete congruence) to 1.0 (complete incongruence; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref034">34</xref>]). Matching cluster weights topological congruency of trees, similar to the widely used Robinson–Foulds metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref035">35</xref>]. However, matching cluster takes into account sections of subtree congruence and therefore is a more refined evaluation of small topological changes that affect incongruence. Significance of the matching cluster and Robinson–Foulds analyses was determined by the probability of randomized bifurcating dendrogram topologies yielding equivalent or more congruent phylosymbiotic patterns than the microbiota dendrogram. Additionally, using the same methodology, matching cluster and Robinson–Foulds metrics were evaluated for Bray–Curtis, unweighted UniFrac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref036">36</xref>], and weighted UniFrac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref036">36</xref>] beta diversity dendrograms at both 99% and 97% clustered OTUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

Despite congruency, the <italic>Nasonia</italic> clade has limited topological complexity with only four species, therefore resulting in a relatively marginal significance. Mice also show nearly perfect congruence, with the exception of <italic>Peromyscus eremicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) showed the lowest topological congruency but were still moderately significant. Four of the six species show correct topological relationships, while the microbial community relationships of <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>erecta</italic> are topologically swapped. These results are different from previous findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that utilized a different experimental design, set of taxa, and sequencing technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref019">19</xref>].

Previous studies detected no pattern of phylosymbiosis across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref019">19</xref>], which could be attributed to <italic>Drosophila’s</italic> constant replenishment of microbes from the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref020">20</xref>] or the dominance by the bacterial genus <italic>Acetobacter</italic>, which is important for proper immune and metabolic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref019">19</xref>].

        <title>Phylosymbiosis Represents a Functional Association</title>
        <p>Microbiota–host distinguishability and topological congruence does not strictly imply that the phylosymbiotic associations are fitness directed, though it naturally follows that a particular host species may be more ideally suited for an autochthonous versus allochthonous microbiota. We therefore performed a series of microbial transplants to test the prediction that inoculated microbiota from a different species would decrease aspects of host performance or fitness in contrast to inoculated microbiota from the same species. Moreover, if there is selection on host–microbiota interactions such that microbiotas are uniquely or better situated for resident host backgrounds, then transplanted microbiota from a divergent species could drive more pronounced reductions in host functions than transplanted microbiota from a closely related species.</p>
        <p>In <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, we followed a previously established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref039">39</xref>] to transplant the microbial communities from six rodent donor species into a single recipient species, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic>, as well as a control group in which the microbial communities from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic> were introduced to intraspecific individuals of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic>. Inventories of fecal microbiota from donor and recipient mice revealed that portions of the donor microbiota successfully transferred. The estimated amount of transplanted OTUs and their relative abundance ranged from 6.5%–26.2% and 11.4%–40.7%, respectively, when analyzed at the 99% OTU cutoff level. Variation in the transfer of foreign microbes was dependent on donor species and its divergence from the recipient species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We then measured dry matter digestibility, or the proportion of food material that is digested by the animal. Consistent with selection on host–microbiota interactions, mice that were inoculated with microbial communities from more distantly related hosts exhibited decreased dry matter digestibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These results were only significant when the group receiving feces from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic> donors was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Notably, the microbiota of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic> is not congruent with our predictions of phylosymbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Thus, only the taxa showing phylosymbiosis exhibited the functional trend with digestibility. Distantly related donor species (<italic>Neotoma lepida</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) did not drive significance, as the correlation remained statistically significant when investigating only <italic>Peromyscus</italic> donors (excluding <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>In the most extreme cases in which mice were inoculated with the microbial communities from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>californicus</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>, there was approximately a 3% decrease in dry matter digestibility, which is on par with the decrease in digestibility observed as a result of helminth infections in <italic>Peromyscus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref040">40</xref>]. Animals must consume more food to meet energy demands when faced with decreases in digestibility. Indeed, mice inoculated with microbial communities from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>californicus</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> exhibited significantly higher food intakes than the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000225.s004">S4 Fig</xref>; Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>californicus</italic> to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.044 for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic>).

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Under phylosymbiosis, host-associated microbial communities form, in part, as a result of interactions with the host rather than through purely stochastic processes associated with the environment. Specifically, we predicted that given closely related animals reared in controlled environments, the relationships of the microbiota would be congruent with the evolutionary relationships of the host species. Previous evidence for phylosymbiosis under controlled regimes existed in <italic>Nasonia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref002">2</xref>] and <italic>Hydra</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref024">24</xref>], and wild populations of sponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref013">13</xref>], ants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref010">10</xref>], and apes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref016">16</xref>] also exhibited this pattern. Here, in a comprehensive analysis of phylosymbiosis in a diverse range of model systems, we report the widespread occurrence of this pattern under strictly controlled conditions as well as a functional basis in the context of host digestive performance in mice and survival in wasps. These results represent the first evidence for phylosymbiosis in <italic>Peromyscus</italic> deer mice, <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, a variety of mosquito species spanning three genera, and <italic>Nasonia</italic> wasp females with the inclusion of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>oneida</italic>. Previous studies in <italic>Nasonia</italic> measured male phylosymbiosis and did not include <italic>N</italic>. <italic>oneida</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref002">2</xref>]. By rearing closely related species from the same host clade in a common environment, and by controlling age, developmental stage, endosymbiont status, and sex, the experiments rule out confounding variables that can influence microbiota relationships in comparative analyses. Eliminating these variables is important because they often substantially correlate with interspecific differences. Thus, our findings demonstrate that a uniform experimental and bioinformatic methodology can excavate host effects on phylosymbiosis from other potentially confounding variables in comparative microbiota studies.</p>
        <p>We observed marked differences in microbial diversity and community structure between mammalian and invertebrate host clades. Mammalian communities were more diverse and dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, while insect-associated communities were less diverse and primarily dominated by Proteobacteria. These results are consistent with previous microbial inventories conducted in mammals and insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref042">42</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest large-scale differences in the host–microbiota interactions between mammals and insects. These differences across host phyla could be due to a variety of possibilities, including host genetics, diet, age, and rearing environment.</p>
        <p>To remove confounding variables that structure host–microbiota assemblages and to rigorously test phylosymbiosis, we utilized an experimental design within four host clades that isolated the effects of host evolutionary relationships from other effects (i.e., diet, age, rearing environment, sex, endosymbionts). We found that host species consistently harbored distinguishable microbiota within each host clade. Additionally, we found significant degrees of congruence between the evolutionary relationships of host species and ecological similarities in their microbial communities, which is consistent with the main hypothesis of phylosymbiosis. These results importantly expand previous evidence for this eco-evolutionary pattern and demonstrate that related hosts reared under identical conditions harbor distinguishable microbial assemblages that can be likened to microbial community markers of host evolutionary relationships. It is conceivable that recently diverged species (i.e., those younger than several hundred thousand years) would have less genetic variation and fewer differences in microbiota composition. Furthermore, divergent hosts may have vast differences in physiology that overwhelm the likelihood of observing phylosymbiosis. Surprisingly, we observed phylosymbiosis to varying degrees in all host clades, and the age of clade divergence positively correlates with the level of intraspecific microbiota distinguishability. Thus, as host species diverge over time, microbial communities become more distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref012">12</xref>], and the limits of detecting phylosymbiosis may occur at extreme scales of incipient or ancient host divergence times.</p>
        <p>The mechanisms by which phylosymbiosis is established requires systematic investigation. Perhaps the most apparent regulator of host–microbiota interactions is the host immune system. A previous study of phylosymbiosis in <italic>Hydra</italic> demonstrated that antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system are strong dictators of community composition, and expression of antimicrobial peptides are necessary for the formation of host-specific microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref005">5</xref>]. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref043">43</xref>], mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref008">8</xref>], and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref044">44</xref>] have identified a large immune effect in which host immune genes can explain variation in microbial community structure. Interestingly, host immune genes often exhibit rapid evolution and positive selection compared to genes with other functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref046">46</xref>]. While this trend is often explained by the host–pathogen arms race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref045">45</xref>], it is also likely due to host evolutionary responses for recruiting and tending a much larger collection of nonpathogenic microbes.</p>
        <p>Other host pathways may also underlie the observed species-specific microbiota signatures. Hosts produce glycans and mucins on the gut lining that may serve as biomolecular regulators of microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref048">48</xref>]. For example, knocking out the gene for α1–2 fucosyltransferase inhibits production of fucosylated host glycans on the gut surface and significantly alters microbial community structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref049">49</xref>]. Additional knockout studies have demonstrated the roles of circadian clock genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref050">50</xref>], microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref051">51</xref>], and digestive enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref052">52</xref>] in determining microbial community structure. These various physiological systems might also interact with one another and may have even evolved in tandem to regulate microbial community structure.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, rather than hosts “controlling” their microbiota, microbes may be active in selecting which host niches to colonize. For example, hosts have been compared to ecological islands, where environmental selection of the microbiota through niche availability may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref053">53</xref>]. However, given the large number of studies that demonstrate the role of microbes in improving host performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref054">54</xref>], we find it unlikely that hosts would assume a solely passive role in these interactions. An elegant study allowed microbial communities from various environments (soil, termite gut, human gut, mouse gut, etc.) to compete within the mouse gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref055">55</xref>]. This study found that a foreign community of the human gut microbiota exhibited an early competitive advantage and colonized the mouse gut first. Later, the mouse gut microbiota dominated and outcompeted the human gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref055">55</xref>]. Thus, community assembly is not a monolithic process of host control but likely a pluralistic combination of host control, microbial control, and microbe–microbe competition. In this context, both population genetic heritability and community heritability measurements of the microbiota will be useful in prescribing the varied genetic influences of a foundational host species on microbiota assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
        <p>The acquisition route of microbes could also influence our understanding of phylosymbiosis. If phylosymbiosis is observed when the microbiota is acquired horizontally from other hosts, the environment, or some combination of the two, then phylosymbiosis is presumably influenced by host-encoded traits such as control of or susceptibility to microbes. However, maternal transmission of microbes is argued to be a common trend in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref057">57</xref>]. For example, sponges exhibit vertical transmission of a diverse set of microbes in embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref058">58</xref>]. Transmission of full microbial communities is unlikely in most systems, given that the communities of developing animals tend to exhibit markedly lower diversity and distinct community structure compared to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref060">60</xref>]. Thus, it is improbable that phylosymbiotic relationships are explained simply by community drift over host evolutionary divergence. There could be a subset of microbial taxa that are more likely to be transmitted from mother to offspring that in turn affect what other microbes colonize. For instance, in humans, the family Christensenellaceae is situated as a hub in a co-occurrence network containing several other gut microbes and has a significant population genetic heritability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref061">61</xref>]. When <italic>Christensenella minuta</italic> was introduced into the guts of humanized mice, the microbial community structure was significantly altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref061">61</xref>]. This microbe, as well as others, can therefore be likened to a keystone taxa or "microbial hub" that can impact community structure despite low abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref063">63</xref>]. Thus, one could hypothesize that phylosymbiotic relationships in some systems may be driven by host transmission of microbial hubs that determine whole community structure through ensuing microbe–microbe interactions. However, further work is needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
        <p>The congruent relationships between hosts and associated microbial communities are likely maintained through their positive effects on host performance and fitness but could be neutral or harmful as well. While the importance and specificity of hosts and microbes in bipartite associations has been demonstrated on host performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref064">64</xref>], it is unclear whether such effects commonly occur for hosts and their complex microbial communities. If they exist, disruption of phylosymbiosis via hybridization or microbiota transplants should lead to reduced fitness or performance. For instance, hybridization experiments demonstrate negative interactions or "hybrid breakdown" between host genetics and the gut microbiota that drives intestinal pathology in house mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref065">65</xref>] and severe larval lethality between <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>giraulti</italic> wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref002">2</xref>]. Furthermore, transplant experiments show that all microbes are not equal for the host. An early study demonstrated that germ-free rabbits inoculated with a mouse gut microbiota exhibited impaired gastrointestinal function compared to those given a normal rabbit microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref066">66</xref>]. Together, these functional studies and others suggest that interactions between hosts and their microbiota are not random and instead occur at various functional levels.</p>
        <p>Here, we add an evolutionary component to these ideas by demonstrating that microbial communities from more evolutionarily distant hosts can be prone to more pronounced reductions in host performance or fitness. Specifically, <italic>Peromyscus</italic> deer mice inoculated with microbial communities from more distantly related species tended to exhibit lower food digestibility. The exception to this trend was the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic> to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic> group, which did not exhibit any decrease in digestibility. It should be noted that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic> also did not follow phylosymbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000225.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), which may explain the departure from our expected trend in digestibility. For example, deviations from phylosymbiosis could be due to a microbial community assembly that is inconsequential to host digestibility. Therefore, transferring a nonphylosymbiotic community between host species may not yield performance costs.</p>
        <p>An alternative explanation for our results could be that hosts are acclimated to their established microbiota, and the introduction of foreign microbiota either elicits a host immune response or disrupts the established microbiota, thus decreasing digestibility. One technique to distinguish between adaptation and acclimation would be to conduct experiments in germ-free <italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic> recipients. However, the derivation of germ-free mammals is a difficult and expensive process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref067">67</xref>] and has not been conducted for <italic>Peromyscus</italic>. Earlier studies utilizing germ-free mammals demonstrate that microbial communities from evolutionarily distant hosts negatively impact gastrointestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref066">66</xref>] and immune development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref068">68</xref>], thus supporting our hypothesis of functional matching between host and the gut microbiota.</p>
        <p>Additionally, among very closely related species, <italic>Nasonia</italic> exposed to interspecific microbiota have lower fitness than those exposed to intraspecific microbiota. While this experiment utilized heat-killed bacteria to avoid shifts in the microbiota composition during media growth, the protocol is sufficient to test the predictions of phylosymbiosis. First, isolated microbial products can exert drastic effects on eukaryotic partners. For example, a sulfonolipid purified from bacteria can induce multicellularity in choanoflagellates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref069">69</xref>]. Additionally, the insect immune system can respond with strain-level specificity to heat-killed bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref070">70</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that each <italic>Nasonia</italic> host species evolved to the products of their own gut microbiota rather than those of gut microbiota from related host species. Together, results from the <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and <italic>Nasonia</italic> functional experiments reveal the importance of host evolutionary relationships when considering interactions between hosts and their gut microbial communities and ultimately the symbiotic processes that can drive adaptation and speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref072">72</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functional bases of phylosymbiosis in various systems demand further studies</p>
        <p>Overall, we have established phylosymbiosis as a common, though not universal, phenomenon under controlled rearing with functional effects on host performance and survival. It is worth emphasizing again that this term is explicit and different from many other similar terms, such as coevolution, cospeciation, cocladogenesis, or codiversification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref073">73</xref>]. While cospeciation of hosts and specific environmentally or socially acquired microbes—e.g., hominids and gut bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref074">74</xref>] or the bobtail squid and <italic>Vibrio</italic> luminescent bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref075">75</xref>]—could contribute in part to phylosymbiosis, concordant community structuring with the host phylogeny is not dependent on parallel gene phylogenies but instead on total microbiota compositional divergence. Phylosymbiosis does not assume congruent splitting from an ancestral species because it does not presume that microbial communities are stable or even vertically transmitted from generation to generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref012">12</xref>]. Rather, phylosymbiosis predicts that the congruent relationships of host evolution and microbial community similarities could have varied assembly mechanisms in space and time and be newly assembled each generation (though see our discussion of transmission routes above). Moreover, the findings here imply that across wide-ranging evolutionary timescales and animal systems, there is a functional eco-evolutionary basis for phylosymbiosis, at least under controlled conditions.</p>
        <p>It may be difficult to detect phylosymbiosis in natural populations because of extensive environmental variation that overwhelms the signal. We suggest that one way to potentially overcome this challenge is to start with laboratory-controlled studies that identify (i) phylosymbiotic communities and (ii) the discriminating microbial taxa between host species. Resultantly, investigations can test whether these microbial signatures exist in natural populations, albeit perhaps in a smaller fraction of the total microbiota that is mainly derived by environmental effects. Another advantage of controlled studies is that the functional effects, both positive and negative, of a phylosymbiotic community assembly can be carefully measured in the context of host evolutionary history.</p>

RFC models were constructed with the supervised_learning script for 1,000 rounds of ten-fold Monte Carlo cross validation on each table. At each level, the results were collated and averages were taken for the ten rarefied tables. Host species were used as the category for RFC model distinguishability, testing the ability to assign samples to their respective host species. The average class error for each clade was subtracted from 100 to get the percent accuracy of the models at each taxonomic level. The same methodology was used for constructing RFC models for the meta-analysis, with the only exception being that host species, host clade, and vertebrate or invertebrate categories were tested for distinguishability.</p>

        <title>Peromyscus</title>
        <p>We tested the effects of allochthonous microbial communities on host performance by conducting a series of microbial transplants from various donor rodent species into a single recipient species, the oldfield mouse (<italic>Peromyscus polionotus</italic>). We obtained virgin, female <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>polionotus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>maniculatus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>leucopus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>eremicus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>californicus</italic>) from the <italic>Peromyscus</italic> stock center. We also obtained three female individuals of <italic>Neotoma lepida</italic> (<italic>Neotoma</italic> is the sister genus of <italic>Peromyscus</italic>) from Dr. M. Denise Dearing (University of Utah). Additionally, we obtained six female individuals of outbred <italic>Mus musculus</italic> from Dr. Wayne Potts (University of Utah). The founding animals of this colony were collected from near Gainesville, Florida, US, and the animals have been randomly bred in captivity for roughly 13 generations and are still highly outbred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref094">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref095">95</xref>]. All rodent species were maintained on powdered laboratory rodent chow (Formula 8904, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin, US) except for woodrats, which were fed powdered rabbit chow (Formula 2031, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin, US), given that woodrats are herbivorous. All procedures involving rodents were approved under the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol #12–12010.</p>
        <p>To conduct microbial transplants, we followed a protocol that was previously established to transplant the microbiota from <italic>Neotoma lepida</italic> into <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref039">39</xref>]. First, donor feces were collected from three to six individuals of each donor species by placing rodents in wire-bottom metabolic cages overnight and collecting feces the next morning. Feces were then ground with a mortar and pestle and mixed into powdered laboratory chow (Formula 8904, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin, US) at a ratio of 15% w/w. Recipient animals (five to six individuals per group) were fed food containing feces of a particular donor species for two nights. Then, recipient animals were fed normal laboratory diets for 6 d, which is a sufficient time for the clearance of transient, ingested microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref096">96</xref>]. We then measured food intake and dry matter digestibility by placing animals into wire-bottom metabolic cages. Animals were presented with a known amount of powdered rodent chow overnight. The next morning, remaining food was weighed, and feces were collected, dried overnight, and weighed. Food intake was calculated as g dry food presented–g dry food remaining. Dry matter digestibility was calculated as (g dry food ingested–g dry feces produced) / g dry food ingested.</p>
        <p>We investigated whether microbial communities from more distantly related hosts affected performance metrics in recipients. We compared food intake using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test across recipient groups. We also conducted correlations of dry matter digestibility and estimated divergence times based off of previously published phylogenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref038">38</xref>]. We performed correlations using both untransformed divergence times and log-transformed divergence times.</p>

        <title>Nasonia</title>
        <p>We tested the effects of allochthonous microbial communities on host survival by exposing two recipient species (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>vitripennis</italic> or <italic>N</italic>. <italic>giraulti</italic>) to a suspension of heat-killed microbes isolated from three donor <italic>Nasonia</italic> species (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>vitripennis</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>giraulti</italic>, and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>longicornis</italic>). We reared <italic>Nasonia</italic> in an in vitro rearing system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000225.ref041">41</xref>] and inoculated germ-free larvae in 6 mm diameter transwell inserts with autochthonous microbiota, allochthonous microbiota, and sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the first 8 d after embryo hatching. Microbiota were purified from fourth instar larvae of <italic>Nasonia</italic> by filtration through a 5 um filter and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. The pellet was suspended in a sterile PBS solution at a concentration of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU of microbiota bacteria (determined by tryptic soy agar plating) per milliliter. 20 uL of this microbiota suspension was added to the transwell inserts for each of the 8 inoculation days. <italic>Nasonia</italic> rearing media was replaced daily just before the inoculations.</p>
        <p>Measurements of <italic>Nasonia</italic> survival from first instar larvae to adulthood were determined using transwell insert images taken with an AmScope MT1000 camera. For each transwell, live larval counts were recorded 3 d post–embryo hatching. Adult counts were determined by recording the number of remaining larvae and pupae in each transwell sample 20 d after embryo hatching (5–7 d after first adult eclosion) and subtracting that number from the larval counts previously recorded. Normalized adult survival per transwell sample was calculated as the percent survival of <italic>Nasonia</italic> from 3 d to 20 d after embryo hatching divided by the average percent survival of the autochthonous microbiota treatment group. We compared survival between the autochthonous and allochthonous treatment groups using Mann–Whitney U tests.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>Pattern classification of human brain activity provides unique insight into the neural underpinnings of diverse mental states. These multivariate tools have recently been used within the field of affective neuroscience to classify distributed patterns of brain activation evoked during emotion induction procedures. Here we assess whether neural models developed to discriminate among distinct emotion categories exhibit predictive validity in the absence of exteroceptive emotional stimulation. In two experiments, we show that spontaneous fluctuations in human resting-state brain activity can be decoded into categories of experience delineating unique emotional states that exhibit spatiotemporal coherence, covary with individual differences in mood and personality traits, and predict on-line, self-reported feelings. These findings validate objective, brain-based models of emotion and show how emotional states dynamically emerge from the activity of separable neural systems.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Functional brain imaging techniques provide a window into neural activity underpinning diverse cognitive processes, including visual perception, decision-making, and memory, among many others. By treating functional imaging data as a pattern-recognition problem, similar to face- or character-recognition, researchers have successfully identified patterns of brain activity that predict specific mental states; for example, the kind of an object being viewed. Moreover, these methods are capable of predicting mental states in the absence of external stimulation. For example, pattern-classifiers trained on brain responses to visual stimuli can successfully predict the contents of imagery during sleep. This research shows that internally mediated brain activity can be used to infer subjective mental states; however, it is not known whether more complex emotional mental states can be decoded from neuroimaging data in the absence of experimental manipulations. Here we show that brain-based models of specific emotions can detect individual differences in mood and emotional traits and are consistent with self-reports of emotional experience during intermittent periods of wakeful rest. These findings show that the brain dynamically fluctuates among multiple distinct emotional states at rest. More practically, the results suggest that brain-based models of emotion may help assess emotional status in clinical settings, particularly in individuals incapable of providing self-report of their own emotional experience.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Functional neuroimaging offers unique insight into how mental representations are encoded in brain activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref002">2</xref>]. Seminal cognitive neuroscience studies demonstrated that distributed patterns of cortical activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) contain information capable of differentiating among visual percepts, including object categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref003">3</xref>] and basic visual features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref004">4</xref>]. Extending findings from these studies, subsequent work demonstrated that machine learning models trained on stimulus-evoked brain activity, termed “decoding” or “mind-reading” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref005">5</xref>], can be used to predict the contents of working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref008">8</xref>] and mental imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref010">10</xref>], even during sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref011">11</xref>]. Thus, pattern recognition approaches can identify defining features of mental processes, even when driven solely on the basis of endogenous brain activity. The approach was further shown to accurately discriminate among multiple cognitive processes (e.g., decision-making, working memory, response inhibition, among others) in independent subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref012">12</xref>], establishing the efficacy of assessing diverse mental states with fMRI across individuals.</p>
        <p>Paralleling cognitive studies decoding task-evoked brain activity, multivariate decoding approaches have recently been used to map patterns of neural activity evoked by emotion elicitors onto discrete feeling states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref014">14</xref>]. However, a key piece of missing evidence is whether categorically distinct emotional brain states occur intrinsically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref016">16</xref>] in the absence of external eliciting stimuli. If so, then it should be possible to classify the emotional status of a human being based on analysis of spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity during rest. Successful classification would validate multivariate decoding of unconstrained brain activity and provides insight into the nature of emotional brain activity during the resting state.</p>
        <p>Adapting the logic of other cognitive imaging studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref017">17</xref>], we postulate that the presence of spontaneous emotional brain states should be detectable using multivariate models derived from prior investigations of emotion elicitation. We previously developed decoding algorithms to classify stimulus-evoked responses to emotionally evocative cinematic films and instrumental music [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>]. These neural models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g001">Fig 1</xref>) accurately classify patterns of neural activation associated with six different emotions (contentment, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, and sadness) and a neutral control state in independent subjects, generalizing across induction modality. Importantly, these neural biomarkers track the subjective experience of discrete emotions independent of differences in the more general dimensions of valence and arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref018">18</xref>]. By indexing the extent to which a pattern of neural activation to extrinsic stimuli reflects a specific emotion, these models can be used to test whether intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity correspond to stimulus-evoked emotional states.</p>

        <p>Here, we evaluate whether these neural models of discrete emotions generalize to spontaneous brain activation measured via fMRI in two experiments. The first experiment assesses if model predictions are convergent with individual differences in self-reported mood and emotional traits. Because individual differences are linked to mental health and subjective well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref021">21</xref>], this evaluation provides insight into the potential clinical utility of quantifying spontaneous emotional states, as they may be associated with risk factors for mental illness. The second experiment employs an experience sampling procedure to evaluate whether model predictions based on brain activity during periods of rest are congruent with on-line measures of emotional experience. Together, these studies probe how brain-based models of specific emotion categories quantify changes in extemporaneous affect both between and within individuals.</p>

        <p>We applied the multivariate models of emotional experience to brain activation acquired from young adults during resting-state fMRI (<italic>n</italic> = 499; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Two consecutive runs of resting-state scans were acquired, spanning a total duration of 8.53 min. Following preprocessing of data, we computed the scalar product of the resting-state signal and emotion category-specific model weights at every time point of data acquisition. This procedure yielded scores that reflect the relative evidence for each of seven emotional states across the full scanning period. A confirmatory analysis revealed that voxels distributed across the whole brain informed this prediction, as opposed to activity in a small number of brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

(B) Frequency distributions for the classification of all seven emotional states (<italic>n</italic> = 499). The mean, 25th, and 75th percentiles are indicated by black lines. The solid gray line indicates the number of trials that would occur from random guessing. The data underlying this figure can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s006">S1 Data</xref>.

        <p>If emotional brain states occur spontaneously, the frequency of classifications from our decoding models should be more varied than the uniform distribution that would be expected by chance. To test this hypothesis, we sought to identify whether the total time (or absolute frequency) in each state differed across emotion categories. Such an analysis informs the degree to which discrete emotional brain states may spontaneously occur and, by extension, could contribute to the identification of individual differences that map onto the likelihood of experiencing specific spontaneous states. To perform this comparison, we identified the single model with the maximum score at each time point (one-versus-all classification) and summed the number of time points assigned to each category. The frequency of emotional states clearly differed across categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, χ<sup>2</sup> = 1491.52, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, Friedman test), in contrast to the uniform distribution that would be expected if emotional brain-states did not occur in spontaneous activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Follow-up comparisons revealed that neutral states occurred more frequently than chance rates (20.1 ± 3.59% [s.d.], <italic>z</italic> = 20.50, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 2.03E-93), followed by states of surprise (18.37 ± 3.87% [s.d.], <italic>z</italic> = 16.38, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 2.47E-60) and amusement (14.71 ± 3.78% [s.d.], <italic>z</italic> = 1.25, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 0.21).

        <p>Although patterns of neural activation were most often classified as neutral as a whole, it is possible that consistent fluctuations in the time course of emotional states occur against this background. Research on MRI scanner-related anxiety has shown that self-report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref023">23</xref>] and peripheral physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref024">24</xref>] measures of anxiety peak at the beginning of scanning, when subjects first enter the scanner bore. This literature predicts that brain states indicative of fear should be most prevalent at the beginning of resting-state runs, and that neutral states should emerge over time, given their overall high prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess gradual changes in the emotional states over time, we performed Friedman tests separately for each emotion category, all of which revealed significant effects of time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Next, we quantified the direction of these effects using general linear models to predict classifier scores using scan time as an input. We found the scores for fear decreased over time (<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = -4.92, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 1.20E-006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g003">Fig 3</xref> gray lines), whereas neutral states exhibited an increasing trend throughout the scanning period (<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0017</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = 7.36, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 7.66E-013), consistent with predictions (additional effects were observed for scores for contentment [<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0017</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = 7.37, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 7.05E-13], surprise [<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e004"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e004g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0010</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = 4.07, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 5.51E-05], anger [<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e005"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e005g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0007</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = -3.36, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 0.00085], and sadness [<inline-formula id="pbio.2000106.e006"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2000106.e006g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000106.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>β</mml:mo><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0034</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, t<sub>498</sub> = -15.59, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> &lt; 2.52E-038]).</p>

        <p>Gray circles reflect the sample mean classification scores for all seven emotions (<italic>n</italic> = 499). Thick colored lines display group-average predicted time course using smoothing splines (with bordering 95% confidence interval).

        <p>To determine whether emotional states exhibited consistent dynamics over the course of the scanning period, we fit smoothing spline models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref025">25</xref>] for each subject and assessed the correlation between each subject and the average time course of other subjects in a cross-validation procedure. This analysis showed that there is substantial moment-to-moment variability in the time course of emotional states across subjects (which cannot simply be explained by scaling differences in the emotion models or resting-state data; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Consistent with the linear models using time as a predictor, evidence for neutral brain states was most prevalent in the second scanning session, especially during a peak at the beginning of the run, whereas the time course for fear peaked at the beginning of the first run and decreased throughout the scanning session. The model for surprise exhibited a similar time course as neutral states but peaked at the end of the second run. Additionally, this analysis showed that evidence for sad classifications peaked in the middle of the first run and decreased over time. Overall, these time series revealed a gradual change in evidence from negative emotions (fear and sadness in run 1) to non-valenced or bi-valenced emotions (neutral and surprise in run 2).</p>
        <p>To ensure that our emotion-specific brain states are not proxies for more general resting-state networks thought to subserve other functions, we examined the spatial overlap between our models and those commonly derived by connectivity-based analysis of resting-state fMRI data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref026">26</xref>]. On average, we observed little overlap (Jaccard index = 13.1 ± 1.97% [s.d.]; range 10.8%–16.7%) with the seven most prominent networks found in resting-state data, implicating a substantial degree of independence.</p>
        <p>To further establish the construct validity of the spontaneous emotional brain states, we reasoned that their incidence should vary with individual differences in self-reported mood and personality traits associated with specific emotions.

        </fig>
        <p>If spontaneous emotional states are accessible to conscious awareness, then scores should be greater for emotion models congruent with self-report relative to scores for models incongruent with self-report. Contrasting emotion models in this manner is advantageous from a signal detection standpoint because it minimizes noise by averaging across emotions, as some were reported infrequently or not at all in some subjects (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref033">33</xref>] for an analogous approach to predict the contents of memory retrieval during similarly unconstrained free-recall). To test our hypothesis, we extracted resting-state fMRI data from the 10-s interval preceding each self-report query and applied multivariate models to determine the extent to which evidence for the emotional brain states in this window predicted the participants’ conscious emotional experience.</p>
        <p>Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that scores for models congruent with self-report were positive (0.016 ± 0.0093 [s.e.m.], <italic>z</italic> = 2.068, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 0.0386; Wilcoxon signed rank test), whereas scores for incongruent models were negative (-0.0048 ± 0.0017 [s.e.m.], <italic>z</italic> = -3.041, <italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 0.0024). Classification of individual trials into the seven emotion categories exhibited an overall accuracy of 27.9 ± 2.1% (s.e.m.) of trials, where chance agreement is 21.47% (<italic>P</italic><sub>unc</sub> = 0.001; binomial test). Not only do these results demonstrate that classification models are sensitive to changes in emotional state reported by participants, but also that there is selectivity in their predictions, as negative scores indicate evidence against emotion labels that are incongruent with self-report. Establishing both sensitivity and selectivity is important for the potential use of these brain-based models as diagnostic biomarkers of emotional states.</p>
        <p>As an additional validation of our decoding models, we examined the correspondence between the prevalence of individual emotional brain states as detected via pattern classification and participant self-report. Classifications based on self-report and multivariate decoding yielded similar frequency distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), in which neutral and amusement were the most frequent.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Converging findings from our experiments provide evidence that brain states associated with distinct emotional experiences emerge during unconstrained rest. Whereas prior work has decoded stimulus-evoked responses to emotional events, our study demonstrates that spontaneous neural activity dynamically fluctuates among multiple emotional states in a reliable manner over time. Observing such coherent, emotion-specific patterns in spontaneous fMRI activation provides evidence to support theories that posit emotions are represented categorically in the coordinated activity of separable neural substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
        <p>Validating the neural biomarkers in the absence of external stimulation suggests that they track information of functional significance, and do not merely reflect properties of the stimuli used in their development. It is possible that these classifiers detect the endogenous activity of distributed neural circuits, consistent with recent views that emotions are not represented in modular functional units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref037">37</xref>]. However, the extent to which such activity is the result of innate emotion-dedicated circuitry, a series of cognitive appraisals, or constructive processes shaped by social and environmental factors remains to be determined (for a review of these viewpoints, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref038">38</xref>]). Regardless of the relative influence of such factors, the present findings suggest that the emotion-specific biomarkers track the expression of functionally distinct brain systems, as opposed to idiosyncrasies of the particular machine-learning problem.</p>
        <p>Our findings complement recent studies demonstrating that a variety of emotion manipulations have lasting effects on resting brain activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref041">41</xref>]. For instance, one study revealed elevated striatal activity following gratifying outcomes in a decision-making task—an effect that was diminished in individuals with higher depressive tendencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref039">39</xref>]. Because these effects immediately followed emotional stimulation, they could plausibly reflect regulatory processes or lingering effects of mood. The present results, on the other hand, show that resting brain activity transiently fluctuates among multiple emotional states and that these fluctuations vary depending on the emotional status of an individual. Thus, emotional processes unfolding at both long and short time scales likely contribute to spontaneous brain activity.</p>
        <p>Findings from our resting state experiment stand in contrast to recent work investigating emotion-specific functional connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref042">42</xref>]. In this study, whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity was assessed using seeds identified from a meta-analytic summary of emotion research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref043">43</xref>]. This latter approach failed to reveal unique patterns of resting-state connectivity for individual emotions but showed that seed regions were commonly correlated with domain-general resting-state networks, such as the salience network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref044">44</xref>]. In light of the present results, it is important to consider methodological differences between studies. Seed-based correlation highlights connectivity between brain regions whose time course of activation is maximally similar to the activity of a small number of voxels (which are averaged together to create a single time series), whereas pattern classification identifies combinations of voxels that maximally discriminate among mental states. Because individual voxels sample diverse neural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref045">45</xref>], it is plausible that seed-based correlation is biased towards identifying networks that have large amplitudes in seeded regions as opposed to exhibiting specificity (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref046">46</xref>]). Thus, our approach may have greater sensitivity to detect discriminable categorical patterns.</p>
        <p>Results of the experience sampling study provide external validation of our emotion-specific biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>]. Consistent with the resting-state study, the overall distribution of emotional states was clearly non-uniform, and classifications of neutral states occurred with high frequency. Beyond these commonalities, the inclusion of behavioral self-report led to differences in emotion-related brain activity. States of contentment and amusement were more frequently predicted during experience sampling compared to resting-state (46.31% versus 23.45%), a finding that was corroborated by higher ratings for these emotions in the self-report data. It is possible that this difference in the frequency of positive brain states is the result of a self-presentation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref047">47</xref>], wherein participants may have employed emotion regulation in order to project a more positive image. Alternatively, it is possible that the self-reporting task requirement elicited more introspection between trials, which contributed to the pattern of altered emotional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref048">48</xref>]. Future work will be necessary to fully characterize how such cognitive-emotional interactions shape the landscape of emotional brain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
        <p>We found that individual differences in mood states and personality traits are associated with the relative incidence of brain states associated with fear, anger, and sadness. These findings further establish the construct validity of our brain-based models of emotion and link subfacets of Neuroticism to the expression of emotion-specific brain systems. Given their sensitivity to individual differences linked to the symptomology of anxiety and depression, spontaneous emotional brain states may serve as a novel diagnostic tool to determine susceptibility to affective illness or as an outcome measure for clinical interventions aimed at reducing the spontaneous elicitation of specific emotions. This tool may be particularly useful to objectively assess the emotional status of individuals who do not have good insight into their emotions, as in alexithymia, or for those who cannot report on their own feelings, including patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state.</p>

        <p>Classification of emotional states was performed using neural biomarkers that were developed based on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to cinematic films and instrumental music [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>]. This induction procedure was selected because it reliably elicits emotional responses over a 1 to 2 min period, as opposed to longer-lasting moods. These models were developed to identify neural patterning specific to states of contentment, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, and sadness (in addition to a neutral control state). These particular emotions were modeled to broadly sample both valence and arousal, as selecting common sets of basic emotions (e.g., fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and happiness) undersamples positive emotions. In selecting these particular emotions, we verified that the accuracy of these models tracked the experience of specific emotion categories (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> across emotions = .57) independent of subjective valence and arousal. Thus, the models offer unique insight into the emotional state of individuals and characterize the likelihood they would endorse each of the seven emotion labels, independent of general factors such as valence or arousal.</p>

        <p>A total of 499 subjects (age = 19.65 ± 1.22 years [mean ± s.d.], 274 women) were included as part of the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS), which assesses a wide range of behavioral and biological traits among healthy, young adult university students. For access to this data, see information provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s007">S1 Text</xref>. This sample was independent of that used to develop the classification models. This sample size is sufficient to reliably detect (β = .01) a moderate effect (r = .2) with a type-I error rate of .05, which is particularly important when studying individual differences in neural activity. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with Duke University guidelines and were in good general health. The participants were free of the following study exclusions: (1) medical diagnoses of cancer, stroke, head injury with loss of consciousness, untreated migraine headaches, diabetes requiring insulin treatment, chronic kidney or liver disease, or lifetime history of psychotic symptoms; (2) use of psychotropic, glucocorticoid, or hypolipidemic medication; and (3) conditions affecting cerebral blood flow and metabolism (e.g., hypertension). Diagnosis of any current DSM-IV Axis I disorder or select Axis II disorders (antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder), assessed with the electronic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref050">50</xref>] and Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV subtests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref051">51</xref>], were not an exclusion, as the DNS seeks to establish broad variability in multiple behavioral phenotypes related to psychopathology. No participants met criteria for a personality disorder, and 72 (14.4%) participants from our final sample met criteria for at least one Axis I disorder (10 Agoraphobia, 33 Alcohol Abuse, 3 Substance Abuse, 25 Past Major Depressive Episode, 5 Social Phobia). However, as noted above, none of the participants were using psychotropic medication during the course of the DNS.</p>
        <p>Participants were scanned on one of two identical 3 Tesla General Electric MR 750 system with 50-mT/m gradients and an eight channel head coil for parallel imaging (General Electric, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA). High-resolution 3-dimensional structural images were acquired coplanar with the functional scans (repetition time [TR] = 7.7 s; echo time [TE] = 3.0 ms; flip angle [α] = 12°; voxel size = 0.9 × 0.9 × 4 mm; field of view [FOV] = 240 mm; 34 contiguous slices). For the two 4 min, 16 s resting-state scans, a series of interleaved axial functional slices aligned with the anterior commissure—posterior commissure plane were acquired for whole-brain coverage using an inverse-spiral pulse sequence to reduce susceptibility artifact (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; α = 60°; FOV = 240 mm; voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm; 34 contiguous slices). Four initial radiofrequency excitations were performed (and discarded) to achieve steady-state equilibrium. Participants were shown a blank gray screen and instructed to lie still with their eyes open, think about nothing in particular, and remain awake.</p>
        <p>Preprocessing of all resting-state fMRI data was conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). Images for each subject were slice-time-corrected, realigned to the first volume in the time series to correct for head motion, spatially normalized into a standard stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute template) using a 12-parameter affine model (final resolution of functional images = 2 mm isotropic voxels), and smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian filter. Low-frequency noise was attenuated by high-pass filtering with a 0.0078 Hz cutoff.</p>

Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open and let their mind wander freely and that a rating screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref054">54</xref>] would occasionally appear, which they should use to indicate the intensity of the emotion that best describes how they currently feel. This validated assay of emotional self-report consists of 16 emotion words organized radially about the center of the screen. Four circles emanate from the center of the screen to each word (similar to a spoke of a wheel), which were used to indicate the intensity of each emotion by moving the cursor about the screen. During four runs of scanning, participants completed 40 trials (10 per run) with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 30 s plus pseudo-random jitter (Poisson distribution, λ = 4 s).</p>
        <p>Self-report data were transformed from two-dimensional cursor locations to categorical labels. Polygonal masks were created by hand corresponding to each emotion term on the response screen. A circular mask in the center of the screen was created for neutral responses. Because terms in the standard response screen did not perfectly match those in the neural models, the item “relief” was scored as “content,” whereas “joy” and “satisfaction” were scored as “amusement.” The items “surprise,” “fear,” “anger,” “sadness,” and “neutral” were scored as normal.</p>
        <p>Scanning was performed on a 3 Tesla General Electric MR 750 system with 50-mT/m gradients and an eight channel head coil for parallel imaging (General Electric, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA). High-resolution images were acquired using a 3D fast SPGR BRAVO pulse sequence (TR = 7.58 ms; TE = 2.936 ms; image matrix = 256<sup>2</sup>; α = 12°; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm; 206 contiguous slices) for coregistration with the functional data. These structural images were aligned in the near-axial plane defined by the anterior and posterior commissures. Whole-brain functional images were acquired using a spiral-in pulse sequence with sensitivity encoding along the axial plane (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; image matrix = 64 × 64; α = 70°; voxel size = 3.8 × 3.8 × 3.8 mm; 34 contiguous slices). Four initial radiofrequency excitations were performed (and discarded) to achieve steady-state equilibrium.</p>
        <p>Processing of MR data was performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). Functional images were slice-time-corrected, spatially realigned to correct for motion artifacts, coregistered to high resolution anatomical scans, and normalized to Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space using high-dimensional warping implemented in the VBM8 toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm.html" xlink:type="simple">http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm.html</ext-link>). Low-frequency noise was attenuated by high-pass filtering with a 0.0078 Hz cutoff.</p>

        <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
        <p>To rescale data for classification, preprocessed time series were standardized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Maps of partial least squares (PLS) regression coefficients from stimulus-evoked decoding models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>] were resliced to match the voxel size of functional data. These coefficients are conceptually similar to those in multiple linear regression, only they are computed by identifying a small number of factors (reducing the dimensionality of the problem) that maximize the covariance between patterns of neural activation and emotion labels (for specifics on their computation, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref055">55</xref>]). Classifier scores were computed by taking the scalar product of functional data at each time point and PLS regression coefficients from content, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, sad, and neutral models. Individual time points were assigned categorical labels by identifying the model with the maximal score.</p>
        <p>In order to determine if relatively focal or diffuse patterns of resting-state activity informed classification, we computed importance maps for each subject (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This was accomplished by calculating the voxel-wise product between PLS regression coefficients for each emotion model and the average activity of acquisition time points labeled as the corresponding emotion. We made inference on these maps by conducting a mass-univariate one-sample <italic>t</italic> test for each of the seven models, thresholding at FDR <italic>q</italic> = .05.</p>
        <p>To address the potential overlap of the emotion classification models and canonical resting-state networks of the brain, we computed the maximal Jaccard index for each emotion model and the seven most prominent resting-state networks identified in Yeo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref026">26</xref>]. This index is computed as the intersection of voxels in the two maps (voxels above threshold in both maps) relative to their union (the number of voxels above threshold in either map). Thresholds for classification models were adaptively matched to equate the proportion of voxels assigned to each resting state network.</p>
        <p>When conducting inferential tests on classification frequency (count data), non-parametric tests were conducted. To test whether classifications were uniformly distributed across the emotion categories, a Friedman test was performed (<italic>n</italic> = 499 subjects, k = 7 emotions). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to test for differences in frequency relative to chance rates (14.3%) in addition to pairwise comparisons between emotion models, and corrected for multiple comparisons based on the false-discovery rate.</p>
        <p>Because the models have different levels of accuracy when used for seven-way classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref013">13</xref>], we additionally conducted wavelet resampling of classifier scores in the time domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref056">56</xref>] over 100 iterations to ensure that differences in the sensitivity of models did not bias results. This procedure involved scrambling the wavelet coefficients (identified using the discrete wavelet transform) of classifier scores (time series in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000106.g003">Fig 3</xref>) to generate random time series with similar autocorrelation as the original data. Classifications were then made on these surrogate time series, and Friedman tests were performed to test for differences in frequencies across categories. This procedure yielded a null distribution for the chi-square statistic against which the observed statistic on unscrambled data was compared.</p>
        <p>To test whether classifier scores changed over time, Friedman tests were conducted on the outputs of the emotion models separately (concatenating the time series across runs), as classifier scores were found to violate assumptions of normality. Follow-up tests on the direction of these changes (either as increases or decreases) were conducted using general linear models with one constant regressor and another for linearly increasing time for each subject. Inference on the parameter estimate for changes over time was made using a one-sample <italic>t</italic> test (498 degrees of freedom).</p>
        <p>In addition to testing gradual changes over time, smoothing spline models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref025">25</xref>] were used to characterize more complex dynamics of emotional states. Because spline models are flexible and may include a different number of parameters for each subject, cross-validation was conducted to assess the coherence of spline fits across subjects. In this procedure, a smoothing spline model was fit for each subject, and its Pearson correlation with the mean fit for all other subjects was computed. The average of resulting correlations accordingly reflects the coherence of nonlinear changes in emotional states across all subjects.</p>
        <p>The influence of individual differences in mood and personality was assessed using generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and a logit link function. Multiple models were constructed, each using a single measure from either the CESD, STAI, or facets from the NEO-PI-R to predict the frequency of classifications for the seven emotion categories (seven models per self-report measure). Inference on parameter estimates (characterizing relationships between individual difference measures and classification frequency) was made using a <italic>t</italic> distribution with 497 degrees of freedom.</p>
        <p>To control for multiple comparisons, FDR correction (<italic>q</italic> = .05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref058">58</xref>] was applied for targeted predictions. For individual differences in mood, this procedure included correction for positive associations between the frequency of sad classifications and CESD scores and between fear classification and STAI values (<italic>P</italic><sub>thresh</sub> = .0091). For differences in emotional traits, correction was applied to models predicting the frequency of fear classification on the basis of Anxiety scores, anger classification using Angry Hostility scores, and sad classifications on the basis of Depression scores (<italic>P</italic><sub>thresh</sub> = .0479). Scatterplots and predicted outcomes for these regression analyses are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000106.s004">S4 Fig</xref>.</p>
        <p>To assess concordance in the experience sampling study, classifier scores were averaged for trials congruent and incongruent with self-report for each subject. For instance, all trials in which a participant self-reported “fear,” the classifier outputs from the neural model predicting fear were considered congruent, whereas the remaining six models were averaged as incongruent. Because the frequency of self-report varied across emotions (e.g., endorsement of fear and sadness were very infrequent), scores were averaged across all trials to reduce noise.</p>
        <p>In a supplemental analysis, scores were extracted separately for all trials and classified by identifying the model with the highest score. Accuracy was assessed on data from all subjects, using self-reports of emotion as ground truth. Because the frequency of self-reported emotions was non-uniform, chance agreement between self-report and neural models was calculated based on the product of marginal frequencies, under the assumption of independent observer classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000106.ref059">59</xref>]. Inference on the observed classification accuracy was tested against this value using the binomial distribution <italic>B</italic>(480, 0.2147). Due to infrequent self-reports of surprise, fear, and anger, accuracy on individual models was not computed.</p>
        <p>Scores were initially assessed by averaging the 10 s preceding each rating. Subsequent analyses increasing the window length up to 20 s did not alter results. Because the scores for congruent (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0186, Lilliefors test against normal distribution) and incongruent (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0453) trials exhibited non-normal distributions, Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to test each sample against zero mean rank. The correspondence between the frequencies of classification labels from self-report and neural decoding was assessed by computing the Pearson correlation for each subject. The correlation coefficients were Fisher transformed and tested against zero using a one-sample <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
        <p>To ensure that population differences (i.e., inclusion of individuals with psychopathology) did not contribute to differences in the prevalence of emotions in the resting-state and experience sampling studies, we re-calculated the frequency of classifications using repeated random subsampling of healthy participants in the resting-state sample (1,000 iterations, sampling 21 participants without replacement). The average correlation between the healthy subsamples and the full sample was very high (r<sub>avg</sub> = .981, s.d. = .013), making it unlikely that clinical status accounts for differences in the frequency of classifications across studies.</p>

        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ), given each month during the transmission season, is recommended for children living in areas of the Sahel where malaria transmission is highly seasonal. The recommendation for SMC is currently limited to children under five years of age, but, in many areas of seasonal transmission, the burden in older children may justify extending this age limit. This study was done to determine the effectiveness of SMC in Senegalese children up to ten years of age.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec002">
        <title>Methods and Findings</title>
        <p>SMC was introduced into three districts over three years in central Senegal using a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised design. A census of the population was undertaken and a surveillance system was established to record all deaths and to record all cases of malaria seen at health facilities. A pharmacovigilance system was put in place to detect adverse drug reactions. Fifty-four health posts were randomised. Nine started implementation of SMC in 2008, 18 in 2009, and a further 18 in 2010, with 9 remaining as controls. In the first year of implementation, SMC was delivered to children aged 3–59 months; the age range was then extended for the latter two years of the study to include children up to 10 years of age. Cluster sample surveys at the end of each transmission season were done to measure coverage of SMC and the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia, to monitor molecular markers of drug resistance, and to measure insecticide-treated net (ITN) use. Entomological monitoring and assessment of costs of delivery in each health post and of community attitudes to SMC were also undertaken. About 780,000 treatments were administered over three years. Coverage exceeded 80% each month. Mortality, the primary endpoint, was similar in SMC and control areas (4.6 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively in children under 5 years and 1.3 and 1.2 per 1000 in children 5-9 years of age; the overall mortality rate ratio [SMC: no SMC] was 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.496). A reduction of 60% (95% CI 54%–64%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the incidence of malaria cases confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a reduction of 69% (95% CI 65%–72%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the number of treatments for malaria (confirmed and unconfirmed) was observed in children. In areas where SMC was implemented, incidence of confirmed malaria in adults and in children too old to receive SMC was reduced by 26% (95% CI 18%–33%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the total number of treatments for malaria (confirmed and unconfirmed) in these older age groups was reduced by 29% (95% CI 21%–35%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). One hundred and twenty-three children were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe malaria, with 64 in control areas and 59 in SMC areas, showing a reduction in the incidence rate of severe disease of 45% (95% CI 5%–68%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031). Estimates of the reduction in the prevalence of parasitaemia at the end of the transmission season in SMC areas were 68% (95% CI 35%–85%) <italic>p</italic> = 0.002 in 2008, 84% (95% CI 58%–94%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in 2009, and 30% (95% CI -130%–79%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.56) in 2010. SMC was well tolerated with no serious adverse reactions attributable to SMC drugs. Vomiting was the most commonly reported mild adverse event but was reported in less than 1% of treatments. The average cost of delivery was US$0.50 per child per month, but varied widely depending on the size of the health post. Limitations included the low rate of mortality, which limited our ability to detect an effect on this endpoint.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>SMC substantially reduced the incidence of outpatient cases of malaria and of severe malaria in children, but no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. Introduction of SMC was associated with an overall reduction in malaria incidence in untreated age groups. In many areas of Africa with seasonal malaria, there is a substantial burden in older children that could be prevented by SMC. SMC in older children is well tolerated and effective and can contribute to reducing malaria transmission.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>In 2012, WHO recommended that children under five years of age living in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission in the Sahel and sub-Sahel should receive seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) for up to four months of the year to prevent malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref001">1</xref>]. It has been estimated that about 25 million children under five years of age resident in 15 countries live in areas suitable for SMC, defined as areas where 60% of annual cases fall in four consecutive months of the year. About 20 million of these children live in areas where estimates of the parasite rate (PfPr2-10) were consistent with an incidence of malaria in excess of 0.1 cases per child per year, areas where SMC is likely to be most cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref003">3</xref>]. Following regional meetings of malaria control programme managers to develop SMC implementation plans and the publication of an implementation guide detailing methods of delivery, monitoring, and evaluation of SMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref005">5</xref>], National Malaria Control Programmes have been quick to adopt this policy. SMC schemes have started in eleven countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo). Seven of these countries are expanding access to SMC through a UNITAID-funded programme (ACCESS-SMC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref006">6</xref>]).</p>
        <p>In some parts of the areas suitable for SMC, the proportional burden of malaria in older children is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref007">7</xref>], reflecting slower acquisition of natural immunity; in these areas, extending the age range for administration of SMC above five years may be justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref008">8</xref>]. The size of the burden in older children is often not apparent to programme managers, because standard reporting templates report the number of malaria cases in three groups (those under five years of age, those over five years of age, and pregnant women) and do not disaggregate age groups above five years of age.</p>
        <p>This study was planned prior to the WHO policy recommendation for SMC to evaluate the effectiveness of SMC using a stepped-wedge design. The study was designed to determine the feasibility of delivering SMC on a large scale to children under five years of age, its safety, and its costs. After the first year of implementation, it was apparent that there was a substantial malaria burden in older children. The intervention was therefore expanded to include all children up to ten years of age in the second and third years of the study in order to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of SMC in this wider age group. This paper reports the study design and the results on effectiveness. The pharmacovigilance system, analysis of coverage, and the economic evaluation are reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

        <title>Ethics</title>
        <p>A series of meetings were held with local government authorities and district health staff to explain the aims and activities of the project. On the first occasion, when the intervention drugs were delivered through house-to-house visits, verbal consent to participate in the SMC programme was sought from the mother or carer of each eligible child using a standard script translated into the appropriate local language (Wolof or Serer), which mentioned the aims of the project and the potential side effects of the study drugs. Verbal consent or refusal was recorded in a register by the community worker. Consent was sought separately for participation in surveys and demographic surveillance. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and by the Conseil Nationale de Recherche in Senegal. The same committees approved an amendment in 2009 to include older children in SMC administration. A Data Safety Monitoring Board monitored the safety aspects of the study.</p>

        <title>Study Site</title>
        <p>The study was undertaken in the health districts of Mbour, Bambey, and Fatick in central Senegal, which have a combined population of about 600,000 and which are served by 54 health posts and three district health centres. The trial profile is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002175.g001">Fig 1</xref>, and the study area and phased design are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002175.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. (Note that Fatick district was subdivided in 2010, part of the original health district forming the new health district of Niakhar; both areas remained in the study). The climate of the study area is sudano-sahelian, with a single rainy season from July to the beginning of October; monthly mean temperature range from 24°C (December–January) to 30°C (May–June).

        <p>Before the study, formative research was done to identify the most suitable methods for delivering SMC, and a pilot implementation was undertaken to assess acceptability to communities and to health staff, to measure compliance, to identify any important constraints, and to provide data to support a funding application for the main study.</p>

        <title>Stepped-Wedge Design</title>
        <p>SMC (then known as intermittent preventive treatment in children [IPTc]) had been shown prior to the planning of this study to be highly effective in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref011">11</xref>], but it was questioned whether the intervention could be delivered on a large scale at reasonable cost, whether it would be acceptable to families, and whether the drugs used for SMC would be safe when deployed on a large scale. It was also unknown if SMC had an impact on mortality. These considerations guided the design and the sample size of the new study. A stepped-wedge design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref012">12</xref>] was chosen, as it was not considered justifiable to include an individual- or community-randomised control group, and, because there was no established delivery channel, implementation needed to be phased in gradually for logistic reasons. It was considered that results from an uncontrolled “before and after” design would be difficult to interpret due to the variability in malaria incidence from year to year.</p>

        <sec id="sec014">
        <title>Randomisation</title>
        <p>Health officials and community leaders agreed to randomisation by health post but asked that intervention progressed at the same rate in all three districts. The health post was the natural cluster, as each health post is responsible for community programmes in their catchment area (median about 9,000 people) and supervises a network of community health workers. The three districts were served by 77 health posts, 54 of which were situated in rural and semi-urban areas and were included in the study. SMC was introduced in steps that were one year apart—9 health posts implemented in year 1, an additional 18 in year 2, and an additional 18 in year 3, leaving 9 that would start in year 4 if the study was extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002175.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s006">S1 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Constrained randomisation was used to avoid chance imbalance between intervention and control areas at each step. Data on the key outcomes (confirmed malaria incidence, all-cause deaths) by cluster were not available prior to the start of the trial, so the randomisation had to be based on proxy variables (distance from river, distance from health centre, population size, number of villages). An assessment of the performance and experience of the staff at each health post (on a 3-point scale) was also included to avoid imbalance in ability to implement SMC. A geographical constraint was included to avoid randomisations that resulted in clumps of intervention and control clusters. The randomisation process was kept secret; health staff knew their status for that year (implement or control) only at the start of the year.

        <title>Delivery</title>
        <p>Delivery was organised by health post using community health workers who visited each household once per month during the transmission seasons of 2008, 2009, and 2010 (in mid-September, mid-October, and mid-November) to administer SMC to children aged 3–59 months (in 2008) and to children up to 10 years of age in 2009 and 2010. The dose of SP and the first dose of AQ was administered by the health worker or by the mother/carer under supervision by the health worker; the remaining daily doses of AQ were left with the mother to administer at home over the next two days. Dates of SMC administration were documented by the health worker in registers and on a family-held record card. Usage and wastage of drugs was tallied. Coverage was estimated independently from surveys each year, sampling from each intervention cluster to yield an overall estimate of annual coverage.</p>

        <title>Drugs</title>
        <p>In 2008, co-blister packs of Dualkin (Pfizer) (SP [500/25 mg tablets] and AQ [200 mg tablets]) were used. These tablets had to be broken and crushed to make half doses for infants. In 2009, 200-mg AQ tablets (Chongqing Qinyang Pharmaceutical) and 500/25-mg SP (Shijizhuang Ouyi Pharmaceutical) tablets were used, and, in 2010, sweetened dispersible tablets of SP (500/25 mg) and of AQ (153 mg) (Kinapharma, Ghana) were given. Clinical episodes of malaria were treated with AQ-artesunate or quinine in 2008 and with artemether-lumefantrine or quinine in 2009 and 2010, following a clinical algorithm that required suspected cases to be tested with an RDT (Paracheck-Pf test, Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India). Amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole were the most commonly used antibiotics.</p>

        <title>Surveillance</title>
        <p>Parasitological diagnosis for malaria was introduced nationally by the Senegalese Ministry of Health the same year our project started. Malaria cases were detected at health facilities by a government nurse or physician at hospitals, district health centres, and health posts, by nurses at mission clinics, or by a community health worker working in “health huts” and in the community. The percentage of malaria treatments that were based on confirmation by RDT or slide was 69% in 2008, 97% in 2009, and 96% in 2010. The number of health huts in the study area increased from 47 in 2008 to 76 in 2010. The breakdown by study zone is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s016">S3 Text</xref>. Apart from this expansion, which occurred in all zones of the study area, there were no major changes in the level of surveillance. Training workshops were held for health post nurses, and close contact was maintained with them through supervisors who visited each health facility once every one to three months, to ensure guidelines were followed and to promote good record-keeping. Confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of malaria was made using an RDT, following an algorithm that required measuring axillary temperature with a thermometer and testing with an RDT (First Response) all persons with fever (temperature ≥37.5°C) who did not have signs of respiratory infection or other obvious causes of the fever. Malaria cases were linked to clusters based on village of residence (we did not attempt to link cases to household members listed in the Demographic Surveillance System [DSS]). Surveillance was maintained in all age groups to allow estimation of the indirect effect of the intervention in terms of a reduction in incidence of malaria in older age groups.</p>
        <p>A pharmacovigilance system was established based on the national system but strengthened through training, supervision, and use of SMS messaging. A simplified DSS was set up, with household visits undertaken approximately every ten months. Deaths were recorded through DSS rounds (referred to as DSS1, conducted from October 2008 to June 2009, DSS2 conducted from October 2009 to July 2010, and DSS3 from October 2010 to December 2010). In 13 health posts, village reporters were trained to record any deaths in their communities, and verbal autopsies were undertaken in these cases. Cluster sample surveys of children were conducted at the end of each transmission season to measure SMC coverage and to take a finger-prick blood sample for parasitology and measurement of haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Households were randomly selected from the DSS, and all children who would have been eligible for SMC resident in those households were included in the survey. Surveillance for malaria and for mortality was continued in 2011 to look for rebound effects.</p>
        <p>A series of in-depth interviews were held with mothers and carers, community leaders, community health workers, health post nurses, and district medical staff using structured interview guides to find out their views on SMC, their knowledge of its benefits and risks, and the acceptability of the intervention. Interviews were recorded and transcribed into French, and transcripts were analysed.</p>

        <sec id="sec018">
        <title>Laboratory Methods</title>
        <p>A finger-prick blood sample was taken during the cross-sectional surveys to make thick films, to take blood spots on filter paper for molecular analysis, and for measurement of Hb concentration using a portable Haemocue machine (Haemocue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden). Slides were dried at room temperature for 48 hours and stained with 6% Giemsa solution. Slide reading was done at the malaria laboratory of the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD). All positive slides and a sample of negative slide were re-read by a second reader; if readings disagreed (about slide positivity or if there was a more than 2-fold difference in parasite density), a third reading was done, and the geometric mean density of the closest readings were used if the slide was judged positive. A subset of slides were read at the Parasitology Department of the Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) of Dakar for quality control purposes. Further details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s016">S3 Text</xref>. Two hundred high-power fields were read to determine parasitaemia and presence of other species (<italic>Plasmodium malariae</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium ovale</italic>, and <italic>Borrelia</italic>) before a slide was declared negative. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasitemia density was calculated as the number of parasites per 100 leukocytes, expressed per μl assuming 8,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. Gametocyte densities were estimated based on the number of gametocytes seen in 200 microscopic fields and the average number of white blood cells seen per field. Samples found positive for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> by microscopy were analysed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing for the presence of mutations in the pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes associated with resistance to SMC drugs. Children with an Hb &lt; 7 g/dL were referred to the health post, where the child was given a course of iron tablets; severely anaemic children were referred to the district health centre for blood transfusion if required. Children with a fever were referred to the health post, their slide was read promptly, and the results were provided to the clinic. Samples of the tablets used were tested at the Laboratoire National de Contrôle des Médicaments, Dakar for drug content and dissolution.</p>

        <title>Statistical Methods</title>
        <p>The primary trial outcomes were all-cause mortality, the incidence of RDT-confirmed malaria treated as outpatients, and the incidence of known drug-related adverse events. Secondary outcomes were coverage of SMC, the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia at the end of each transmission season, the prevalence of molecular markers associated with resistance to SP and to AQ, and the incidence of severe malaria defined as admission to hospital for at least 24 hours with a primary diagnosis of malaria. Sample size calculations to detect an effect on all-causes mortality were done for a range of scenarios, with the assumption that the mortality rate (all causes) would be 20 per 1,000 in children 3–59 months of age (based on estimates from the Niakhar DSS) and assuming 30% of deaths were due to malaria (determined from verbal autopsies in Niakhar and the proportion of deaths in hospital attributed to malaria). We also assumed a coefficient of variation between health posts of 0.25 to 0.3 and SMC effectiveness against malaria to be 70%. Calculations using the method of Hemming and Girling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref013">13</xref>] for the stepped-wedge design, assuming k = 0.3 and a median population of children aged 3–59 months of 1,400 per cluster, gave a power of about 17%, 52%, and 99% for reductions of 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively, if the mortality rate was 10/1,000 and 11%, 32%, and 86% power for the same reductions if the rate was 20/1,000.</p>
        <p>Effectiveness of SMC was estimated by fitting a Poisson regression model to the data on the number of deaths and the number of RDT-confirmed malaria cases in each health post occurring in the period starting from the date of the first round of SMC and ending one month after the last round of SMC each year. The number of person-months at risk obtained from the DSS was included as an offset, and a gamma-distributed random effect was used to allow for correlation within clusters. Covariates included in the model were age group, calendar year, and indicator variables for the effect of SMC in children (under five years in 2008 and under ten years in 2009 and 2010) and for the indirect effect of SMC in older age groups. Interaction terms were included to compare effects in the two age groups, and combined effects were estimated where there was no evidence of interaction. The indicator variable representing SMC direct effects was set to 1 if that age group received SMC in that cluster in that year and set to 0 otherwise. The indicator variable for indirect effects was set to 1 for all non-SMC age groups if SMC was implemented in children in that cluster and set to zero otherwise. Thus the direct effect that was estimated represents the sum of direct and indirect effects, and the indirect effect estimated represents the indirect effect only. Rebound effects were assessed by comparing the incidence of malaria during 2011 and 2012, after intervention had stopped, in children living in areas where SMC had been provided for up to three years, with children of the same age in areas that did not have SMC.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p>A census undertaken in May 2008 identified approximately 600,000 persons who were normally resident in the study area, living in 1,247 villages. Coverage with long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLIN) in children was similar in all zones, ranging from 45% to 59% in the first year of the study and increasing to 67% to 77% by the third year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002175.t001">Table 1</xref>). SMC implementation started in September 2008 in Zone 1, treating about 14,000 children aged 3–59 months each month (mid-September, mid-October, and mid-November). About 90,000 children under ten years of age were treated in 2009, and about 160,000 were treated in 2010.</p>

        <p>The proportion of children who received three monthly SMC treatments in 2008 was 93% (95% CI 91%–95%), estimated from a survey of 1,019 children in 9 health post areas; the corresponding figure in 2009 was 84% (95% CI 82%–87%) (<italic>n</italic> = 3,397) and 93% in 2010 (95% CI 91%–96%) (<italic>n</italic> = 882). A high level of adherence to daily doses was reported. The main reason for missed doses was that the caregiver was away when the health worker visited. Fewer than 1% refused, and less than 1% of children missed SMC because of illness on the day of treatment; those who did miss SMC due to illness on the day of treatment were referred to the health facility. When asked about adherence to the two doses of AQ left for the caregiver to administer, 9.6% reported difficulties giving these doses.</p>

        <p>A total of 1,001 RDT-confirmed cases of malaria were recorded in children &lt;10 years in 2008, 310 in 2009, and 1,111 in 2010. The number treated for malaria without an RDT being performed was 1,231 in 2008 but fell to 73 in 2009 and 17 in 2010, following expansion of a new national policy of “test and treat” in 2009. In Zone 6, which did not receive SMC, the incidence of RDT-confirmed malaria during the transmission season was 2.0/1,000 in children under five years of age in 2008, 0.2/1,000 in 2009, and 4.3/1,000 in 2010 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s005">S5</xref> Figs). The reasons for the very low incidence in 2009 are not known. Rates of confirmed cases in under 5′s in SMC areas were 2.8,0.36 and 2.0 per1000 in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 transmission seasons respectively and 2.2, 0.51 and 4.3 in control areas in the same years.

The incidence rate ratio comparing SMC and control areas, adjusted for effects of calendar time, for RDT-confirmed malaria during the transmission season was 0.43 In children under five years of age and 0.39 for children five to nine years of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002175.t002">Table 2</xref>), giving reductions of 57% (95% CI 48%–63%) in the younger group and 61% (95% CI 55%–67%) in the older group, an overall effectiveness of 60% (95% CI 54%–64%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

The proportion with parasites with <italic>pfdhfr</italic> and <italic>pfdhps</italic> mutations was similar in SMC and non-SMC areas (prevalence ratios SMC: non-SMC, adjusted for study year, were 0.90 [95% CI 0.79–1.02] for the <italic>pfdhfr</italic> triple mutation and 0.98 [95% CI 0.80–1.21] for the <italic>pfdhps</italic> mutation at codon 437), whereas the CVIET haplotypes of <italic>pfcrt</italic> and the <italic>86Y</italic> polymorphism of pfmdr1 were more common in SMC areas (prevalence ratios 1.46 [95% CI 0.70–3.05] for <italic>pfcrt</italic> CVIET, 1.86 [95% CI 1.04–3.34] for <italic>pfmdr1</italic> 86Y, and 1.09 [95% CI 0.82–1.47] for <italic>pfmr1</italic> 184F). When the overall prevalence of pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfcrt, and pfmdr1 mutations was compared (including both infected and uninfected children in the denominator), the prevalences were lower in SMC areas than in control areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

        <title>Adverse Events</title>
        <p>No cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome were seen in children who received SMC. One child had an extra-pyramidal syndrome associated with AQ taken during SMC but recovered. Three serious adverse events were considered possibly related to SMC: an acute diarrhoeal illness, a case of rash and facial oedema, and a case of jaundice. The average percentage of children who attended clinic within ten days of an SMC round with symptoms attributed to SMC drugs was 0.1% in 2008, 0.2% in 2009, and 0.14% in 2010. The most commonly reported symptom was vomiting. Details of adverse events are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

        <title>Incidence of Malaria in SMC and Control Areas in the Year after Intervention</title>
        <p>Children could have received SMC for up to three years, depending on their age and implementation zone. The number of previous years of SMC can be defined for each age group in each zone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002175.s013">S8 Table</xref>); for example, those living in areas where SMC implementation started in 2008, if they were aged 3–59 months when SMC started in 2008, could have received SMC for up to three years; these children would be aged from three years and three months to seven years at the start of the 2011 transmission season. When the incidence of malaria in 2011 was compared in relation to the number of years of SMC, the rate ratio for three years of previous SMC, compared with no previous SMC, was 1.18 (95% CI 0.84–1.67); for two years of SMC, 1.09 (95% CI 0.82–1.45); and for one year of SMC, 0.77 (95% CI 0.59–1.01), after adjusting for effects of age.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>This trial showed that SMC delivered to children under ten years of age by district health teams on a large scale was highly effective in reducing the malaria burden in young and older children by at least 60%, that the intervention was well tolerated and well accepted by communities, and that high coverage could be achieved at moderate cost. There was a substantial reduction in the incidence of malaria and in the prevalence of parasitaemia, and, importantly, our results were consistent with an indirect benefit in age groups too old to receive SMC themselves.</p>
        <p>We found a reduction in the incidence of severe malaria, but we did not observe a reduction in all-cause mortality. No reduction in the prevalence of anaemia was observed. In previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref014">14</xref>], the effect of SMC on anaemia has differed between studies; this may reflect differences in the extent to which malaria is an important cause of anaemia in different populations.</p>
        <p>In areas of intense transmission, the main burden of severe malaria disease is in young children, but, as the intensity of transmission decreases, an increasing proportion of cases occur at older ages, reflecting slower acquisition of natural immunity; in these areas, wider age group could be included in SMC programmes.</p>
        <p>Despite high coverage and the contribution of a herd effect, SMC effectiveness was somewhat lower than the efficacy observed in clinical trials (efficacy of 75% against uncomplicated and severe malaria, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref015">15</xref>]). This may be partly due to the use of RDTs to diagnose malaria. These can give a false positive result, as the HRP (histidine-rich protein) persists after infections have been treated, reducing specificity and biasing effectiveness estimates downwards. Care was taken to assign malaria cases to clusters on the basis of their place of residence, but there could have been some misclassification, which would also reduce estimates of effectiveness. We may have somewhat overestimated coverage by sampling, at the end of the transmission season, the population resident at that time, excluding families that were present for only parts of the transmission season whose children may have missed SMC doses. Our results could have been influenced by effects of other interventions: these included distribution of LLINs and a campaign of mass treatment with azithromycin in Bambey district. However, randomisation, which was balanced by district, should have minimised the impact of this source of bias. During one year of the trial, malaria incidence was unexpectedly very low. The reasons for this are not known, as malaria surveillance methods were unchanged and no reduction in mosquito density was seen in that year in the four areas where entomological monitoring was done.</p>
        <p>An effect on transmission brought about by the clearance of infection in a substantial proportion of the population (children under ten years of age represent about 30% of the population and account for about 40% of all outpatient malaria cases) is not unexpected. The use of microscopy to detect gametocytes may have underestimated the prevalence of gametocyte carriage, but there was a substantial reduction in the prevalence of asexual parasitaemia, and it is likely this was accompanied by a reduction in gametocyte prevalence. We were not able to measure an effect of SMC on entomological inoculation rates; this would be challenging due to the very low sporozoite rates. The randomisation zones were well balanced at baseline, and the stepped-wedge design permits adjustment for pre-intervention incidence, so a chance imbalance is unlikely to account for the observed findings.</p>
        <p>We found no evidence that children who had received SMC for up to three years were at increased risk of malaria the year after SMC stopped. This is consistent with the relatively low incidence of malaria and the consequently slow pace of naturally acquired immunity in untreated children in the study area.</p>
        <p>SMC programmes will increase selection pressure for drug resistance, but the rate at which this will occur is not known. In our study, children who had <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection at the end of the transmission season were more likely to carry the <italic>pfmdr1</italic> 86Y mutation associated with AQ resistance if they came from areas where SMC had been implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref014">14</xref>], but the effect of this on the spread of resistance may be mitigated to some extent by the much lower prevalence of infection in SMC areas; the overall proportion of children carrying parasites with these mutations was consequently lower in SMC areas than in areas where SMC had not been implemented.</p>
        <p>We did not observe an effect on all-cause mortality. There had been a gradual reduction in mortality rates in the years before the study related to improved vaccination coverage and access to primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref016">16</xref>], but the sudden drop in mortality in our study was unexpected. It may partly reflect a reduction in malaria transmission associated with scaling up of universal coverage of LLINs and may also be related to increased use of antibiotics. When RDTs for malaria were introduced in Senegal in 2007 and 2008, there was increased use of antibiotics, as guidelines for health facility workers stipulated that persons who tested negative for malaria should be given a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Although we were not able to demonstrate an effect on all-cause mortality, a reduction in the incidence of severe malaria was observed; there may, therefore, have been a reduction in malaria-specific mortality, but the overall number of deaths and the proportion due to malaria was too low for this effect to be measured.</p>
        <p>Including older children increases the cost of SMC programmes, but in our study, which employed door-to-door delivery, did not greatly increase the overall time required for delivery, as older children could readily be treated during health worker visits.</p>
        <p>A Technical Expert Group of WHO reviewed evidence about SMC in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref002">2</xref>], including preliminary results from this study. SMC was recommended for high-incidence areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002175.ref001">1</xref>]; our study area fell outside these recommendations on the basis of a low incidence of malaria, and so our implementation was not expanded, but monitoring was continued to assess rebound effects. SMC is now being implemented in the south of Senegal, where the burden is higher, for children up to ten years of age. In 2015, SMC programmes took place in nine countries, in about 7 million children. Apart from in Senegal, SMC is currently being provided only for children up to five years of age, but, in many areas, the burden in older children may justify extending this range. Our study shows that, in some areas, expanding the age range for SMC could have a substantial impact on the malaria burden and could contribute to reducing malaria transmission.</p>

        health priorities must expand beyond eradication of communicable diseases
        to include control of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD). Four primary
        NCD – cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes,
        some cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases — henceforth referred to as
        “physical” NCD — are responsible for 35 million deaths annually. They are
        the leading cause of mortality in the world, much of which is premature and
        avoidable. Nearly 80% of NCD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Mathers1\">[1]</xref>. Over the
        last 20 years, the burden of disease, i.e., the impact of NCD worldwide as
        measured by morbidity and mortality, rose from 47% to 54% <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Murray1\">[2]</xref>. An aging population, longer life
        expectancies, population growth, urbanization, and globalization of risk factors
        have made NCD a threat to worldwide development and economic growth and an
        urgent global health priority.</p>\n<p>This article, the third in a series
        of five, argues that mental health care should be integrated into the NCD
        agenda, reviews the evidence for models of integration in high- and low-income
        countries, identifies the challenges and opportunities for addressing the
        rising burden of mental health and NCD, and recommends strategies to advance
        a more integrated agenda.</p>\n</sec><sec id=\"s4\">\n<title>Evidence for
        Integration</title>\n<sec id=\"s4a\">\n<title>The Strong Connection between
        Mental Illness and NCD</title>\n<p>The burden of mental illness has been underestimated,
        in part, because the links between mental health and other health conditions
        are not well understood. As the population grows and ages, more individuals
        live longer with physical NCD and mental illness <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Murray1\">[2]</xref>.
        These chronic conditions are related in complex ways. Major modifiable risk
        factors for NCD, such as poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and
        harmful alcohol use, are exacerbated by poor mental health. Mental illness
        is a risk factor for NCD; its presence increases the chance that an individual
        will also suffer from one or more chronic illnesses. In addition, individuals
        with mental health conditions are less likely to seek help for NCD and symptoms
        may affect adherence to treatment as well as prognosis <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Druss1\">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Prince1\">[4]</xref>.</p>\n<p>Depression
        and disorders related to alcohol use predict the onset, progression, management,
        and level of disability associated with the NCD <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Anderson1\">[5]</xref>–<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Parry1\">[7]</xref>. The prevalence of
        major depression is consistently higher for persons with physical illnesses
        than for those without these disorders; e.g., 29% with hypertension, 22% with
        myocardial infarction, 27% with diabetes, and 33% with cancer <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-World1\">[8]</xref>. The odds of noncompliance with medical
        treatment regimens are three times greater for depressed patients compared
        with non-depressed patients <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-DiMatteo1\">[9]</xref>.
        Health-related quality of life is significantly lower for depressed patients
        than for patients with asthma, arthritis, and diabetes <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Moussavi1\">[6]</xref>.</p>\n<p>Alcohol use is causally
        linked to eight different cancers, and the risk of developing these cancers
        increases with increased rate of consumption. Similarly, alcohol use is related
        to many adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, hemorrhagic
        stroke, and atrial fibrillation, and to various forms of liver disease and
        pancreatitis <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Parry1\">[7]</xref>.</p>\n<p>The
        life expectancy of patients with psychotic disorders is two decades shorter
        due to the cardiovascular disease that may co-occur with their mental health
        condition <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Saha1\">[10]</xref>.
        Other major comorbidities among psychotic patients include prediabetes and
        diabetes mellitus. When antipsychotic drugs are prescribed, the risk of weight
        gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sudden cardiac death <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Muench1\">[11]</xref> increases.</p>\n<p>The bottom line
        is that the pathways leading to comorbidity of mental disorders and physical
        NCD are complex and bi-directional, and care for persons with these conditions
        needs to be coordinated.</p>\n</sec><sec id=\"s4b\">\n<title>The NCD Care
        Agenda and Mental Health Care</title>\n<p>Despite the emerging evidence that
        links mental illness and physical NCD, and the high costs of unaddressed mental
        illness on society, mental health care is too often left out of discussions
        on NCD and the global health care agenda.</p>\n<p>Without integration of mental
        health care into the NCD agenda, current NCD initiatives will be less effective
        and more costly. The comorbidities of mental disorders and NCD are associated
        with substantial individual and societal health care costs <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Kessler1\">[12]</xref>. According to the Agency for Healthcare
        Research and Quality (AHRQ), the five most costly conditions in the United
        States between 1996 and 2006 were heart disease, trauma-related disorders,
        cancer, asthma, and mental disorders, with the largest increase in expenditures
        being for mental and trauma-related disorders <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Soni1\">[13]</xref>.
        Care for people with three or more chronic conditions accounts for more than
        80% of Medicare health care costs in the United States <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Anderson1\">[5]</xref>. According to the 2005 National
        Claims Database, the presence of comorbid depression or anxiety significantly
        increased expenditures. The average monthly increase paid by Medicare in 2005
        over previous years' expenses for individuals with depression or anxiety was
        $560 and $710, respectively <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Melek1\">[14]</xref>.</p>\n<p>NCDs
        pose a substantial economic burden that will evolve into a staggering one
        globally over the next 20 years. According to the World Economic Forum, NCD,
        including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes
        and mental disorders, will result in a global cumulative output loss of US
        $47 trillion over the next two decades <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Bloom1\">[15]</xref>.
        High-income countries currently bear the majority of the economic burden for
        NCD; however, this burden is expected to be even greater for low- and middle-income
        countries as their economies and populations grow.</p>\n</sec><sec id=\"s4c\">\n<title>The
        Collaborative Care Model</title>\n<p>The growing burden of NCD and mental
        disorders demands new ways of organizing health systems and clinical practices
        to deal with new challenges. As many as 15 to 30% of all patient referrals
        for mental health care are made by primary care physicians; mental health
        care and NCD care should be offered together in primary care platforms <xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Starfield1\">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Patel1\">[17]</xref>. A promising strategy is to use a
        collaborative care model, which restructures the roles of health care providers
        and introduces a team-based approach to management of chronic and complex
        medical conditions. Tasks can be shifted and shared with specialists supporting
        primary care providers and community health workers to routinely identify
        patients who need care (case finding); assess risk factors; educate patients
        about their illnesses, risk factors, and treatment; intervene with a combination
        of brief evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments; teach
        self-management skills; monitor patients' progress and adherence to treatment;
        and follow-up over the long term.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of collaborative
        care in improving quality of care and patient outcomes is well established
        for single conditions, such as depression in primary care settings <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Gilbody1\">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Wells1\">[20]</xref>.
        Increasingly, its effectiveness is recognized for the treatment of depression
        among patients with cancer <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Ell1\">[21]</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Ell2\">[22]</xref>, diabetes <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Ell3\">[23]</xref>, and hypertension in high-income countries
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Shojania1\">[24]</xref>.</p>\n<p>Evidence
        also supports the effectiveness of collaborative care in treating patients
        with alcohol-related disorders. Screening, brief interventions such as motivational
        interviewing, and referral are feasible and can be effective in primary care
        settings for treating individuals who engage in high-risk drinking <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Moriarty1\">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Jonas1\">[26]</xref>.
        In 23 trials, brief (10- to 15-minute) multi-contact interventions among adults
        receiving behavioral interventions decreased consumption by 3.6 drinks per
        week from baseline and reduced heavy drinking episodes by 12%. In addition,
        11% more adults compared with control participants reported drinking less
        than the recommended limits over a 12-month period.</p>\n<p>Studies of collaborative
        care for multiple conditions are virtually nonexistent. In one study in the
        United States, Katon et al evaluated a primary care-based intervention where
        screening, education, and treatment were provided simultaneously for patients
        with major depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or coronary heart
        disease. Findings at 12 months showed improved glycated hemoglobin, systolic
        blood pressure, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and depression
        outcomes as well as reported quality of life and treatment satisfaction <xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Katon1\">[27]</xref>. Interestingly,
        improvements in the primary outcomes in this study were larger than those
        in other care management trials for single condition depression <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Gilbody1\">[18]</xref>, diabetes <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Shojania1\">[24]</xref>, and hypertension <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Walsh1\">[28]</xref>. Cost-effectiveness analyses showed
        that small increases in mental health costs in the first year were offset
        by cost savings in the second year. Cost savings were observed for up to 5
        years <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Katon2\">[29]</xref>.</p>\n<p>Although
        emerging evidence suggests that collaborative care is also effective in low-
        and middle-income countries, such as Chile, India, Uganda, Vietnam, South
        Africa, and Pakistan <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Lancet1\">[30]</xref>–<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Honikman1\">[37]</xref>, the focus of
        much of this work was on the management of depression in primary care settings
        rather than on that of comorbidities explicitly. An exception is the successfully
        implemention in Chile of the Regime of Explicit Health Guarantees (AUGE),
        a health reform policy to address health inequalities and improve access,
        quality, opportunity, and financing for priority NCD, including mental disorders
        (<xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"pmed-1001443-box002\">Box 1</xref>).</p>\n<boxed-text

        1. Case Example: The Chilean National Depression Treatment Program</title>\n<p>In
        September 2004, the flagship program of Chilean health reform, the Regime
        of Explicit Health Guarantees (AUGE), became law. This program was conceived
        to tackle the huge inequalities in health services in Chile by explicitly
        tackling issues related to access, quality, opportunity, and financing <xref

        health conditions including depression. All citizens have the right to receive
        timely and appropriate treatment for these conditions from their private or
        state health providers. The National Depression Treatment Program that resulted
        from the reform has successfully integrated mental health treatment into primary
        care platforms across a network of 520 primary care clinics. Following evidence-based
        clinical guidelines tested in Chile <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Araya1\">[35]</xref>,
        the program is led by psychologists and general practitioners who are supported
        by specialists to provide pharmacological therapy and psychosocial interventions
        for diabetes, hypertension, and depression. The depression program guarantees
        treatment of mild to moderate depression and has grown steadily with more
        than 200,000 patients receiving treatment every year since 2006 <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"

        from low- and middle-income countries has expanded the evidence on collaborative
        care by demonstrating that task-shifting can be extended to lay health workers,
        particularly when interventions are simplified and proper supervision is provided
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Kakuma1\">[38]</xref>. A tiered
        system of supervision between specialists and primary care providers and between
        primary care providers and community health workers is feasible in resource-constrained
        settings and can strengthen the capacity of health care settings.</p>\n</sec></sec><sec
        id=\"s5\">\n<title>Challenges and Opportunities</title>\n<p>We have a challenge
        and an opportunity: to embed mental health care services into primary health
        care platforms globally. Although these services are being integrated into
        some primary care settings in the United States and other high-income countries,
        the collaborative care model has not been widely adopted. Low- and middle-income
        countries face greater challenges because of grossly under-resourced primary
        care systems and an even weaker mental health infrastructure. Treatment for
        most mental health conditions is largely provided in large psychiatric hospitals
        without adequate referral networks in all levels of care and health systems
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Eaton1\">[39]</xref>. Limited human
        resources, lack of training in mental health and NCD care, and fragmentation
        within the health systems pose significant challenges. However, health care
        systems in low- and middle-income countries are developing and changing rapidly,
        creating an opportunity to shape these systems as well as to learn how best
        to embed mental health services in a variety of different health system environments
        and socio-cultural contexts <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Prince1\">[4]</xref>.</p>\n<p>It
        is now imperative that the mental health and NCD agendas are coordinated to
        leverage current political and funding commitments, particularly those aimed
        at reaching the Millennium Development Goals <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Miranda1\">[40]</xref>.
        The recent 2011 United Nations High Level Summit on NCD and the 2012 World
        Health Assembly focused on the four largely preventable NCD and recognized
        the need to address the growing burden of mental health conditions. In doing
        so, they presented an opportunity for increased attention on the inter-relationships
        among these disorders and coordinated treatments. The board of the Global
        Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Daar1\">[41]</xref>
        has included mental health care as one of its mandates, and the United States
        National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has become an integral member of
        GACD. Fortunately, through these policy efforts, Grand Challenges initiatives
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pmed.1001443-Collins1\">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"

        rid=\"pmed.1001443-Lancet2\">[44]</xref>, these issues are being raised and
        addressed. With international pressure for the World Health Organization to
        implement a Global Action Plan for Mental Health, the time to promote a coordinated
        global mental health and NCD agenda could not be more opportune.</p>\n</sec><sec

        the Rise in NCD</title>\n<p>The world population continues to grow. The largest
        increase is expected in individuals over 60 years of age, who are disproportionately
        affected by NCD. As urbanization accelerates, aging populations encounter
        risk factors for NCD that are associated with urban lifestyles, such as poor
        diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol use. Health care must respond
        to the changing global demographics and to the increased risks associated
        with lifestyle changes in all age groups. Policy interventions such as the
        “Best Buys” (e.g., taxation of tobacco and alcohol sales) identified by the
        World Economic Forum could promote healthy environments and reduce vulnerabilities
        to NCD. Interventions that change risky behaviors related to smoking, nutrition,
        alcohol, physical activity, and weight control could be implemented in primary
        care settings, especially for at-risk individuals. Public health education
        and promotion of health literacy and healthy lifestyles are needed to help
        individuals understand and modify their risks and to do so early in life.
        Integrated interventions targeted especially at the aging population could
        help in the identification and management of multiple chronic diseases.</p>\n<sec

        of chronic disease relies on opportunistic case finding, assessment of risk
        factors, detection of early disease, identification of high-risk status, combined
        pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, and long-term follow-up with
        regular monitoring and promotion of adherence to treatment. Collaborative
        care models are financially feasible and have the potential to substantially
        reduce the burden of managing chronic diseases. Many interventions can be
        managed effectively by non-specialists and lay health care workers who are
        supported by specialists. Although implemented in a range of settings, collaborative
        care models are delivered best in primary care settings.</p>\n</sec><sec id=\"s6c\">\n<title>Promote
        Task-sharing and Task-shifting</title>\n<p>Most current research focuses on
        task-shifting from mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, to physicians
        and nurses. However, a small but growing literature from low- and middle-income
        countries suggests that lay health care workers also can be effective, especially
        when providing screening, psycho-education, and brief behavioral interventions.</p>\n<p>A
        well-established body of research exists on implementation of evidence-based
        practices by primary care providers in high-income countries, including interpersonal

        therapy for management of depression and anxiety conditions and motivational
        interviewing for alcohol use disorders. Other evidence suggests these same

        workers with abbreviated training in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n</sec><sec

        System Environments</title>\n<p>Input from those who live in the communities
        where collaborative care interventions are implemented can be invaluable in
        ensuring that the interventions are appropriate and sustainable within local
        health systems. Local leaders, health providers, caregivers, and patients
        can provide information about local needs, risk behaviors, and the availability
        of resources. Where health providers are scarce and family orientation is
        strong, the engagement of family and other caregivers may also support patients
        in making healthier lifestyle choices, adhering to treatment regimes, and
        better managing their chronic conditions. The use of context-appropriate,
        community partner strategies can empower communities to leverage local resources

        Funding for Primary and Mental Health Care and for Research</title>\n<p>Primary
        health care and mental health care are generally underfunded around the globe,
        especially in low- and middle-income countries. In-country investments are
        needed to demonstrate national ownership, which is key to translating these
        commitments to real policy and system changes. To meet the challenge of providing
        integrated mental health and physical NCD care at the primary care level,
        more investments are needed to strengthen health care systems, to expand the
        roles of traditional providers to manage multiple chronic diseases, and to
        train these individuals for those roles.</p>\n<p>The evidence for integrating
        NCD care and mental health care into primary care comes largely from studies
        in high-income countries focused on patients with co-morbid physical NCD and
        depression. More research is needed to understand the best strategies for
        integrating care for chronic illness with care for a wide range of mental
        health conditions, particularly alcohol use disorders and severe mental illness,
        and to address the implementation of collaborative care models into settings
        in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n    <p>Efforts to sustain and scale
        up of efficacious interventions in primary care settings face several challenges.
        Health workers are already overburdened with many responsibilities, and in
        many settings, there are not enough resources to regularly supervise lay health
        workers and to support them with specialist advisors. More research is needed
        to examine how to best train lay health workers, what tasks can be shifted
        to what type of provider, coordination of care between NCD and mental health
        specialists, and what supervision models are needed to support effective implementation

        policy makers, practitioners, consumers, public health researchers, development
        agencies, and funding organizations to develop globally coordinated strategies.
        However, without country-level recognition and uptake, research and policy
        guidelines will never translate into action. Economic and health policy makers,
        including government officials who control health budgets, are often not aware
        of the links between NCD, mental health, development, and economic growth.
        These leaders need to be part of the global discourse and the development
        of local solutions. We must invest in designing health care systems that recognize
        and address the comorbidity between mental disorders and chronic physical
        illnesses before we are crippled by the rise in NCD and mental health conditions.</p>\n</sec></body>\n<back>\n<ack>\n<p>The

        <p>Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions and caused by loss of function mutations in <italic>Filamin B</italic> (<italic>FLNB)</italic>. FLNB acts as a signaling scaffold by linking the actin cytoskleteon to signal transduction systems, yet the disease mechanisms for SCT remain unclear. Employing a <italic>Flnb</italic> knockout mouse, we found morphologic and molecular evidence that the intervertebral discs (IVDs) of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal development as a result of abnormal cell fate changes in the IVD, particularly the annulus fibrosus (AF). In <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice, the AF cells lose their typical fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This change is characterized by hallmarks of endochondral-like ossification including alterations in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of the disc tissue. We show that conversion of the AF cells into chondrocytes is coincident with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP induced p38 signaling as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic>. These findings indicate that FLNB is involved in attenuation of TGFβ/BMP signaling and influences AF cell fate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IVD disruptions in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice resemble aging degenerative discs and reveal new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Whereas there is a large foundation of knowledge concerning skeletal formation and development, identifying the molecular changes behind Intervertebral Disc (IVD) aging and degeneration has been a challenge. The loss of Filamin B, a protein component of the cell’s cytoskeletal structure, gives rise to Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by fusions of the vertebral bodies. Similarly, mice lacking the Filamin B protein show fusions of the vertebral bodies. We found that these fusions are caused by the early degeneration and eventual ossification of the IVDs. Our study demonstrates that this degeneration is caused by the increase in TGFβ and BMP activity, developmental pathways essential in bone and cartilage formation. These findings represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the molecular basis of IVD degeneration. as well as revealing filamin B’s role in TGFβ/BMP signaling regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the study of the rare disease spondylocarpotarsal synostosis in a model organism can uncover mechanisms underlying more common diseases. Finally, our findings provide a model system that will facilitate further discoveries regarding disc degeneration, which affects a significant proportion of the population.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of more than 450 disorders characterized by abnormalities in patterning, development, and maintenance of the skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref001">1</xref>]. Congenital vertebral deformities in some of these disorders, particularly those that lead to progressive fusions, cause chronic pain and deformity and the mechanisms underlying the development of these fusions are poorly understood. Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder caused by nonsense mutations in <italic>Filamin B (FLNB);</italic> it is characterized by progressive vertebral, carpal, and tarsal bone fusions, short stature, and scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref002">2</xref>]. The vertebral fusions can occur prenatally, leading to the appearance of an ectopic bar of bone spanning multiple vertebral bodies at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>Development of the axial skeleton, including the vertebral bodies, occurs via the process of endochondral bone formation, in which a cartilage template is replaced by bone. Endochondral bone growth occurs through the cartilage growth plate, a stratified tissue consisting of reserve, resting, proliferating, and hypertrophic chondrocytes which ultimately undergo apoptosis, leaving voids that become inhabited by osteoblasts forming the primary spongiosa. Vertebral bodies of the axial skeleton develop through endochondral ossification and are separated from each other by intervertebral discs (IVDs). The IVD forms a fibrous joint that functions as a shock absorber for the spine and allows for slight flexion. Each IVD consists of two functional domains: the inner gel-like center of the nucleus pulposus and the outer fibrous tissue of the annulus fibrosus (AF). At the interface between the IVD and the vertebral body lies the endplate, a transitional tissue of mineralized matrix surrounding hypertrophic-like chondrocytes.</p>
        <p>The process of endochondral ossification requires the coordination of multiple signaling pathways. TGFβ/BMP signaling is essential for early cartilage and bone formation as well as postnatal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref005">5</xref>]. The BMP and TGFβ pathways signal via their canonical receptor phosphorylated Smads (R-Smads) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref007">7</xref>]. The TGFβ pathway signals through R-Smads 2 and 3 while the BMP pathway utilizes R-Smads 1, 5, and 8. Upon ligand binding the receptors phosphorylate and activate the R-Smads. The activated R-Smads translocate to the nucleus and form complexes with additional proteins to induce or repress target gene transcription. Both pathways also utilize the MAPK/ERK and TAK1/p38 pathways as non-canonical signaling pathways. Misregulation of TGFβ and BMP signaling affects many aspects of skeletal development, including formation of the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref008">8</xref>], and over-activation of these pathways has been shown to cause ectopic bone formation in several tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref011">11</xref>]. The IVD AF, as well as cartilage, ligament, and tendon tissues, are derived from progenitor pools consisting of distinct cell populations with unique expression profiles. While TGFβ and BMP signaling are critically important in musculoskeletal tissues, studies have recently shown that each of these distinct cell populations responds differently to changes in these respective signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Filamins are cytoskeletal proteins that stabilize actin filament networks and link them to the cellular membrane, thus forming a scaffold for integrating cell mechanics and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref013">13</xref>]. Filamins have also been shown to interact directly with Smads 2 and 3, as well as 1 and 5, central mediators of canonical TGFβ and BMP signaling, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref015">15</xref>]. FLNB is expressed throughout the cartilage growth plate as well as in the cartilaginous condensations of developing vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref016">16</xref>]. Biallelic loss of function mutations leading to loss of FLNB cause SCT, while heterozygosity for missense mutations in <italic>FLNB</italic> produces a spectrum of autosomal dominant skeletal disorders including boomerang dysplasia (OMIM 112310); Larsen syndrome (OMIM 150250); and atelosteogenesis I and III (AOI, OMIM 108720; AOIII, OMIM 108721).</p>
        <p>In this study we used mice homozygous for a gene trapped <italic>Flnb</italic> allele (<italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref017">17</xref>]. We previously showed that <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice phenocopy SCT and show progressive vertebral, carpal, tarsal, and sternal fusions as well as smaller overall body size, making this an ideal animal model for studying progressive vertebral fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref017">17</xref>]. Mice heterozygous for the gene trap are unaffected. FLNB is expressed in the developing skeleton, throughout the growth plate, in the developing limb buds and between the neural arches of the vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref017">17</xref>] as well as in the somites, which include the cells destined to become the vertebral bodies and IVDs of the spine. It was initially hypothesized that SCT vertebral fusions resulted from failure to segment the vertebrae properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref019">19</xref>], but analysis of the <italic>Flnb</italic> knockout mouse model demonstrated that the vertebrae form normally but subsequently fuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref017">17</xref>]. In this study, we seek to explain how absence of FLNB produces spinal fusions, the most compelling phenotypic finding in both humans and mice. We demonstrate that in the absence of FLNB, TGFβ and BMP signaling is increased both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, demonstrating that FLNB is required for the attenuation of TGFβ/BMP signaling. We also show that the mutant AF undergoes ectopic differentiation toward a chondrogenic lineage in the IVD, leading to abnormal endochondral ossification. The phenotypic findings resemble those seen in aging disc degeneration and therefore provide a developmental model for degenerative disc disease.</p>

Our previous study demonstrated initially normal formation of the IVD, but did not determine the precise time points at which ectopic ossifications and fusions occur. To investigate the spinal phenotype, <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>and <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> skeletal preparations were stained with alcian blue (to stain cartilage proteoglycans) and alizarin red (to stain mineralized bone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Ectopic bone formations are seen between the neural arches of the thoracic region of the spine beginning at E17.5 and progressing through P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">1A′–1C′</xref>, arrows). These formations likely represent the ossification of the interspinous ligaments. Development of thoracic vertebral fusions (T7, T8, and T9) began later, at P5, and progressed as shown in P15 vertebrae (n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">Fig 1D and 1D′</xref>). Lumbar vertebrae (T13, L1, and L2) are nearly completely fused by P19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">Fig 1E and 1E′</xref>). By P21 IVDs have completely disappeared at the thoracic and lumbar fusion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g001">Fig 1F and 1F′</xref>). These observations show that the spinal phenotype is indeed progressive and begins in the thoracic area of the spine before progressing to the lumbar vertebrae.</p>

        <p>We demonstrated FLNB expression in the AF and nucleus pulposus of E14.5 mice via X-gal staining, indicating that FLNB plays a role in the development of these tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005936.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Histological analysis of sagittal IVD sections from P1 to P15 showed that the IVDs developed apparently normally until P1 but IVD disruptions were evident by P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Within the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>vertebral body growth plates there was an initial increase in size of the proliferative zone at P1, followed by an increased zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes at P5 and P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2A′–2C′</xref>) as compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). By P15 this increase in hypertrophy was less evident as the vertebral growth plate reached its final stage of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2E and 2E′</xref>). In addition, the vertebral body heights were significantly shorter in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005936.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This was likely due to the accelerated chondrocyte differentiation observed in the growth plate that removed chondrocytes from the proliferative pool, resulting in decreased longitudinal growth. Investigation of the nucleus pulposus showed that beginning at P5, the nucleus pulposus became compressed and the disruption became more severe as the IVD aged as demonstrated in P7, P11, and P15 IVDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2B′–2E′</xref>).</p>

        <title>Absence of FLNB induces ectopic differentiation towards chondrogenic lineages in AF tissue</title>
        <p>Using sagittal sections of the vertebral spine in both <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>, we observed starting at P7 the cells of the AF begin to exhibit a change in morphology by becoming rounder and more hypertrophic in appearance as demonstrated in P7, P11, and P15 IVDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g002">2C′–2E′</xref>, black arrows). These findings suggest that a process of cell transformation occurred in the AF cells of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mouse spines rather than solely the encroachment of the existing growth plate. A closer examination of P15 IVDs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref> revealed that <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice exhibited a developing front of chondrocyte-like cells and an expanding acellular matrix that overtook the cells of the nucleus pulposus leading to a fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, asterisk). This expanding front of cells led to a narrowing of the nucleus pulposus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In the posterior AF of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs, the cells became rounder, resembling the hypertrophic-like cells normally found in the cartilaginous endplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, arrows).</p>

        <p>Because hypertrophy is associated with changes in matrix composition, we examined AF matrix structure and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref020">20</xref>]. Loss of polarized birefringence visualized with picrosirius red staining indicated a severe disruption of the collagen structure with the fibers becoming thinner and more irregular in the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVD, indicating matrix disorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3E–3H</xref>). Additionally, the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mouse IVD spaces exhibited markedly increased alcian blue staining indicating greater proteoglycan content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3I and 3J</xref>, arrow). To further investigate the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVD matrix, we probed for specific collagen distributions and demonstrated an increase in type II collagen staining in the outer AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3K and 3L</xref>, arrows) as well as a decrease in type I collagen staining in the AF of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice compared with <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3M and 3N</xref>). This change in the type II: type I collagen ratio, as well as an increased proteoglycan content, is indicative of a change from a fibrous to a more cartilaginous matrix.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether there were cell fate changes in the AF cells, we examined the AF and nucleus pulposus regions of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mouse spines for expression of the chondrocyte specific markers Indian Hedgehog (IHH) for prehypertophic chondrocytes and Matrix Metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) for hypertrophic chondrocytes. There was an early increase in IHH expression within the AF of P7 <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3O and 3P</xref>). We also observed a subsequent increase in MMP13 expression throughout <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>P15 IVDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3Q and 3R</xref>) compared with <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>. These findings are consistent with the gradual inappropriate and premature differentiation of AF cells to a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. Additionally, we carried out TUNEL staining to detect apoptotic activity characteristic of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3S and 3T</xref>). Whereas in the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> section, apoptotic activity is restricted to the hypertrophic region of the vertebral growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3S</xref>), there is evidence of increased apoptotic activity in the AF as well as the nucleus pulposus of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g003">Fig 3T</xref>, arrows). We also performed RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on frozen sagittal sections of the mouse spine at P15 using a Collagen X (<italic>ColX</italic>) riboprobe to detect <italic>in vivo ColX</italic> expression, a known specific marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes.

        <p>Although we have shown that AF cells adopt gene expression patterns of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs, we further sought to determine if these findings result from transformation of AF cells as opposed to invasion by chondrocytes. Thus, we crossed <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice with mice containing a GFP reporter driven by the <italic>Scleraxis (Scx)</italic> promoter. SCX expression is used as a marker for tendons, ligaments, and AF tissue, but not chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref021">21</xref>]. Using paraffin embedded spine sections, we stained for GFP expression in the IVD. At ages P7 and P15, the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> IVDs showed SCX expression in the AF tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, white arrows). Importantly, SCX expression was also observed in the inappropriately transformed hypertrophic cells of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs at P7 and P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g005">Fig 5A′ and 5B′</xref>, white arrows). Co-expression of SCX in cells that also express genetic markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes indicated that AF cells become hypertrophic chondrocytes. These findings show that the AF cells differentiate from a fibroblast-like cell to prehypertrophic then hypertrophic-like chondrocytes, leading to destruction of the nucleus pulposus through apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Loss of FLNB up-regulates BMP mediated TAK1/p38 signaling in the postnatal IVD affecting homeostasis</title>
        <p>The BMP signaling pathway is an inducer of chondrocyte differentiation. Therefore, observed ectopic ossification of IVDs seen in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice suggested a possible increase in BMP signaling activation. Similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> TGFβ experiments, we stimulated primary sternal chondrocytes with BMP-2 ligand. Although the data indicated a trend towards increased phosphorylation of receptor Smad1,5,8, we did not see a statistically significant change in treated mutant versus <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> primary sternal chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). We therefore tested whether there was an alteration in non-canonical signaling within the mutant chondrocytes. We detected a significant increase in the phosphorylation of p38 in both unstimulated and BMP-2 stimulated mutant sternal chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). A previous study by Liu et al. demonstrated that increases in BMP activated TAK1/p38 result in inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref026">26</xref>]. We therefore tested whether the increase in p-p38 in our mutant chondrocytes exhibited the same inhibitory effect. Similar to the TGFβ stimulation experiments, <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>cells have increased p-ERK at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), adding complexity to the <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses of p-ERK. However, although there was an endogenous increase of ERK phosphorylation levels in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>chondrocytes, these levels were no longer increased after 10 minutes and significantly decreased after 30 minutes of BMP-2 stimulation in mutant versus <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Our finding supports that increased BMP-2 activation of p38 results in inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and shows non-canonical up-regulation of the BMP pathway in the absence of FLNB. The Liu et al. study also demonstrated that p38 inhibition of ERK had the ability to increase Smad1 nuclear activity and localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref026">26</xref>]. To determine if there was augmented pathway activation through increased p-p38 and decreased ERK, we performed a <italic>Msx2</italic> luciferase assay in primary sternal chondrocytes using a p-Smad1,5 reporter construct to test for potential increased R-Smad1,5,8 nuclear activity. <italic>Msx2</italic> is a direct target of Smad mediated BMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref027">27</xref>]. We observed an endogenous increase of <italic>Msx2</italic> transcription in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>chondrocytes compared with <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Further, to determine if BMP signaling pathway targets are inappropriately activated in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs, we interrogated by western blot analysis whole tissue IVD lysates for expression of BMP-2, a target of the pathway, as well as p-Smad1/5/8 and p-p38 levels. There was a statistically significant increase in BMP-2 expression and an increase of p-p38 in the IVDs of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice with no change in p-Smad1/5/8 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Increased total BMP-2 and <italic>Msx2</italic> transcription are consistent with increased BMP pathway output.</p>

        <p>We subsequently tested whether an increase in Smad1 nuclear localization can be directly visualized in the AF of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice. In the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> discs, p-Smad1,5,8 proteins were found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of AF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9A–9D</xref>, arrow). However, in the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>AF, p-Smad1,5,8 predominantly demonstrated nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9A′–9D′</xref>, arrow) with very little cytoplasmic staining. Consistent with our earlier TGFβ experiments, we demonstrated the same increased nuclear localization of p-Smad3 in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>AF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9E–9H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">9E′–9H′</xref>, arrows). To confirm these findings we determined nuclear versus cytoplasmic levels of p-Smad1,5,8 and p-Smad3 by western blot analysis of stimulated primary chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9I–9L</xref>). As previously demonstrated, this data set also showed an increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear p-Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9K and 9L</xref>). Similar to the previous BMP-2 stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, total cytoplasmic p-Smad1,5,8 levels were unchanged in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> versus mutant chondrocytes, yet the nuclear fraction showed increased Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g009">Fig 9I and 9J</xref>). Taken together, these findings are consistent with a model in which the levels of canonical BMP signaling are not impacted by loss of <italic>Flnb</italic>, but the increase in non-canonical phosphorylation of p38 results in increased Smad1 nuclear activity due to the inhibition of ERK.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Our <italic>Flnb</italic> knockout model shows that absence of FLNB leads to progressive fusions of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae with patterns directly phenocopying those seen in SCT patients. We focused on the spine because it is the most severely affected region of the skeleton in both SCT patients and <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice. Our results indicate that the spinal fusions in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice initiate in the thoracic vertebrae before progressing into the lumbar region. Within the <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>cartilage growth plates of the vertebral body flanking the IVD space, there was an initial expansion of proliferative chondrocytes at P1, followed by an expansion of the hypertrophic zone at later stages. This change in growth plate morphology suggests that the growth plate chondrocytes undergo an accelerated differentiation cycle in the absence of FLNB, as has been seen in the growth plates of appendicular elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>Further, in the posterior AF of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>IVDs, the cells are rounder and enlarged, resembling the cartilaginous cells normally found only in the endplate. The findings of altered collagen composition and structure, along with increases in sulfated proteoglycans, type II collagen, IHH, MMP13 expression, <italic>ColX</italic> expression, and apoptosis are indicative of advancing chondrocyte maturation in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>AF. The transforming <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>cells also continue to express the AF marker SCX, showing that the observed hypertrophic cells are inappropriately transformed AF cells. This suggests that the AF cells in the IVD of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice undergo an inappropriate transition from fibroblast-like to chondrocytic cells, culminating in transition to terminally differentiated chondrocytes that undergo apoptosis. Whereas MMP13 is used as a marker for late hypertrophic chondrocytes, it also plays a role in matrix degradation as it degrades collagens and cleaves aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref029">29</xref>]. While its’ inappropriate expression in the AF may be due to the changes in AF cell fate, the consequences of its expression likely results in matrix disruption and decreased ability of the IVD to absorb mechanical forces. It is likely that changing cellular characteristics and the disruption of the extracellular matrix (ECM) reduces the ability of the IVD to absorb mechanical stress, resulting in the collapse of the IVD. The final consequence of these changes is that the IVD transitions through endochondral ossification to bone, producing vertebral fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005936.g010">Fig 10</xref>). In our model, the IVD fusions progress posteriorly to anteriorly and these changes in IVD morphology are temporal with spinal fusions and disappearance of the IVD by P21.</p>

        <p>TGFβ/BMP signaling has long been implicated in ectopic bone formation and the combination of both TGFβ and BMP up-regulation produces more ectopic bone formation than BMP up-regulation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref030">30</xref>]. Our findings of increased canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling supports previous findings by Zheng et al. that demonstrated up-regulated TGFβ signaling through increased p-Smad3 in a different <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mouse model that also exhibited vertebral fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref015">15</xref>]. Supporting our findings of enhanced TGFβ signaling activity, we showed increased <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA expression of the TGFβ transcriptional targets <italic>Ctgf</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>. p21 protein acts as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase CDKs 2, 3, 4, and 6 and participates in cell cycle inhibition through the TGFβ pathway. Its up-regulation is associated with increased hypertrophic differentiation in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref032">32</xref>]. The premature onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy observed in the vertebral growth plates of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice may result from premature cell cycle exit coupled with accelerated differentiation caused by increased p21 expression. Additionally, <italic>Hu et al</italic>. described a decrease in CDK phosphorylation as well as enhanced chondrocyte differentiation after FLNB knockdown, which supports our data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref028">28</xref>]. Interestingly, a study conducted by Sohn et al. elegantly demonstrated (using a knockdown model of the TGFβ receptor TGFβR2 under the control of a Col2a1cre promoter) that the consequences of loss of TGFβ signaling in the embryonic sclerotome results in disruption of IVD development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref008">8</xref>]. This study showed that TGFβ signaling is essential to IVD embryonic development and our findings further show the importance of TGFβ signaling on postnatal IVD homeostasis.</p>
        <p>BMP signaling has been consistently implicated as one of the primary inducers of chondrocyte differentiation. We did not observe increased p-Smad1,5,8 levels in response to BMP-2 stimulation either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, BMP-2 stimulation did increase BMP activated p38 phosphorylation, a component of TAK1/p38 non-canonical signaling. Further, in <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>chondrocytes after BMP-2 stimulation there was diminished ERK phosphorylation at 30 minutes consistent with previous work that showed p38 functions in the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway (Liu at al., 2012). This p38 induced inhibition of ERK results in increased Smad1 nuclear activity and localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref026">26</xref>]. Our findings of enhanced <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of <italic>Msx2</italic>, a direct target of BMP Smad mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref027">27</xref>] and increased nuclear localization of p-Smad1,5,8 supports that in the absence of FLNB, there is activation of the BMP pathway through the p38 and subsequent inhibition of ERK. The aforementioned <italic>Hu et al</italic>. study showed no change in p-ERK levels in their ATDC5 cell model. This difference may result in part from different outcomes in knockout versus knock-down models.</p>
        <p>FLNB is expressed throughout the developing skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref017">17</xref>], yet the increase in TGFβ/BMP signaling has a profound effect specifically on the AF and the vertebrae growth plate. The vertebral body growth plate, endplate and annulus fibrosus are all derived from the same mesenchymal tissues arising in the sclerotome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref033">33</xref>]. The morphological fate of these tissues is governed by the differential levels and ratios of pathway activation and gene expression. A recent study showed that cartilage, ligament/tendon, and IVD tissues develop from distinct progenitor pools that express Sox9, an SRY related transcription factor that is important in the regulation of cartilage development, and/or Scleraxis (Scx), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor highly expressed in tendons and ligaments as well as the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref021">21</xref>]. Whereas tendon progenitors are mainly derived from Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>–</sup> progenitor pools, short ligaments and the IVD AF are derived from Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup> progenitor pools. Cartilage is derived from Scx<sup>–</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells. An additional study showed that knockdown of BMP signaling in Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup> (ligament/IVD) expressing progenitor cells inhibits tissue development and differentiation indicating that Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup> expressing cells are more sensitive to changes in TGFβ/BMP signaling whereas Scx<sup>–</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup> and Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>–</sup> expressing progenitor cells are less sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref034">34</xref>]. In human SCT as well as our mouse model, the affected tissues include cartilage, ligaments, and the IVD. We have demonstrated FLNB expression in the developing annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of E14.5 mice, implying that the absence of FLNB may have a more profound effect on these Scx<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup>, TGFβ/BMP sensitive cell populations. In our model, the persistent up-regulation of TGFβ/BMP signaling occurring throughout postnatal development of the axial skeleton is likely to disrupt the normal molecular balance in signaling and induce a change in cell fate. These findings suggest that a crucial role of FLNB is to regulate and attenuate TGFβ/BMP signaling in these tissues in order to maintain normal morphological boundaries during postnatal tissue development.</p>
        <p>In the postnatal IVD, it is vital that signaling and matrix integrity be maintained within the disc, and degeneration is caused by a loss of homeostasis. In aging disc degeneration, the cells of the AF go from a spindle shape to a more rounded chondrocyte-like shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref035">35</xref>], collagen fibers become thinner and more irregular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref036">36</xref>], and IVDs exhibit a fissure between the nucleus pulposus and AF boundary as well as increased apoptotic activity within the nucleus pulposus and the AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref037">37</xref>]. An increase in MMP13 production has also been shown in degenerated discs and identified as one of the causative factors in the reorganization of the matrix due to its tendency to cleave aggrecan and collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref029">29</xref>]. These morphologic and molecular findings are those seen in the IVDs of <italic>Flnb</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice. Previous work in aging disc degeneration has shown increases in BMP and TGFβ signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref038">38</xref>]. Additionally, patients harboring activating Smad3 mutations exhibited increased Smad3 phosphorylation levels coupled with disc degeneration beginning as early as 12 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref039">39</xref>]. These findings further support that inappropriate and increased TGFβ and BMP signaling due to the absence of FLNB is phenotypically and molecularly similar to aging degenerating discs and suggests that our model may be useful in dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying this common disease process.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In our study, we demonstrated that loss of FLNB in a mouse models produces an alteration in AF cells from a fibrous to a cartilaginous fate and disruption of the nucleus pulposus, leading to degeneration, subsequent collapse of the disc followed by fusion of the flanking vertebral bodies. This phenotype results from inappropriate up-regulation of the TGFβ canonical and BMP non-canonical pathways. Previous studies have interpreted that the observed increases in TGFβ/BMP signaling within degenerative discs occur as an effort to repair the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005936.ref040">40</xref>]. Because elevated p-Smad2 and 3 were observed in chondrocytes prior to IVD disc degeneration, our model suggests that increased TGFβ and BMP signaling as a consequence of loss of FLNB initiates the cascade of cell fate changes including differentiation, subsequent IVD degeneration and bony fusions. This study has revealed the cascade of some molecular mechanisms governing the development of vertebral fusions and postnatal disc maintenance and degeneration, providing insights which may direct studies that lead to rationale targets for therapeutic solutions.</p>

        <p>Mouse primary chondrocytes were extracted from the ribcages of P1 mice. Ribcages were digested in 1mg/ml Type II Collagenase (Life Technologies)/serum free DMEM solution (GIBCO) for two hours in a 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The liberated cells were subsequently filtered through a 40um sterile cell strainer and plated in DMEM + 10% FBS (GIBCO). Primary chondrocytes were stimulated at multiple time points using recombinant human TGFβ-1 (R&amp;D, 10ng/ml) ligand and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Six biological replicates were performed for stimulation experiments. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific). Three biological replicates were performed for stimulated cell fractionation experiments.</p>
        <p>IVD discs were dissected from P15 mouse spines in PBS using a dissecting microscope. IVDs were placed in DMEM + 10% FBS (GIBCO) until dissections were complete. Discs were then washed with PBS, transferred to a 15mL conical tube containing a 10mL solution of DMEM + 0.03% Type II Collagenase (Life Technologies) and incubated overnight in a 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The next day, the Collagenase was neutralized with DMEM +10% FBS, the cells collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 7 minutes, washed with PBS and the solution was passed through a 40um filter to removed larger particulates. For protein lysates, after centrifugation again at 1,000 rpm for 7 minutes, the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, P0044) and protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340). We used discs T5 through T11 for protein analysis.</p>

        <p>During embryogenesis the spinal cord shifts position along the anterior-posterior axis relative to adjacent tissues. How motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the spinal cord while their axons reside in adjacent tissues compensate for such tissue shift is not well understood. Using live cell imaging in zebrafish, we show that as motor axons exit from the spinal cord and extend through extracellular matrix produced by adjacent notochord cells, these cells shift several cell diameters caudally. Despite this pronounced shift, individual motoneuron cell bodies stay aligned with their extending axons. We find that this alignment requires myosin phosphatase activity within motoneurons, and that mutations in the myosin phosphatase subunit <italic>mypt1</italic> increase myosin phosphorylation causing a displacement between motoneuron cell bodies and their axons. Thus, we demonstrate that spinal motoneurons fine-tune their position during axonogenesis and we identify the myosin II regulatory network as a key regulator.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Embryonic development requires tight coordination between tissues as they frequently grow at different rates. Such differential growth rates can cause shifts between neighboring tissues, and are a particular challenge for individual cells that span multiple tissues, in part because mechanical tension on such cells is predicted to be high. Here we examine how motoneurons whose cell bodies reside in the spinal cord while their axons traverse adjacent tissues compensate for tissue shifts. We find that in zebrafish, motor axons extend into adjacent tissues at a time when both, spinal cord and adjacent tissues grow at different rates and shift positions against each other. Despite this pronounced shift, individual motoneuron cell bodies stay aligned with their extending axons. We demonstrate that the regulatory network of the molecular motor protein myosin II in motor neurons is key for this alignment as mutations in the myosin phosphatase subunit <italic>mypt1</italic> increase myosin phosphorylation and cause a displacement between motoneuron cell bodies and their axons. Movements between spinal cord and adjacent tissues are conserved from fish to humans, and it is therefore likely that similar mechanisms exist in mammals to ensure correct neuronal alignment to compensate for tissue shifts.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>It has been long recognized that during embryonic development of multicellular organisms, differential growth rates and morphogenetic movements of adjacent tissues are highly coordinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, the developing vertebral column and the spinal cord exhibit differential growth rates and shift relative to one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref003">3</xref>], suggesting that mechanisms exist to ensure coordinated development between these two anatomically and functionally highly interconnected tissues. The relative shift between the vertebral column and the spinal cord poses a particular challenge for developing motoneurons. While their cell bodies reside in the spinal cord, their axons exit the spinal cord and traverse tissues that grow at a different rate, thus necessitating developmental mechanisms to constantly adjust either axonal projections or cell body positions relative to one another.</p>
        <p>Although morphogenetic movements between the developing spinal cord and adjacent tissues are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref003">3</xref>], whether axons or cell bodies adjust their position to compensate for tissue shifts has not been examined. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between such tissue shifts relative to when motor neurons extend their axons into adjacent tissues is unknown. The general view is that neuronal migration ceases prior to axon initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref005">5</xref>], calling into question whether neuronal cell bodies can even adjust their position while their axons are actively growing. Only in a few cases, such as cortical projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref008">8</xref>] or brachial facial pioneer motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref009">9</xref>], have neurons been observed to continue their migration after neurite formation. Thus, the cellular and the molecular mechanisms by which developing motoneurons compensate for shifts of tissues through which their axons extend are not well understood.</p>
        <p>Here we use live cell imaging to track the alignment of individual spinal motoneurons and their pathfinding axons relative to adjacent notochord cells. We find that after the onset of axonogenesis notochord cells shift their position caudally relative to that of identified motoneurons. Despite a dramatic shift, motoneuron cell bodies remain well aligned with their axons, suggesting an underlying mechanism that enables motoneurons to adjust their position. In fact, we identify myosin phosphatase as a cell intrinsic regulator that ensures compensatory fine tuning of spinal motoneuron position to maintain alignment with their extending motor axons. Combined, our data reveal a previously unappreciated role for the myosin II regulatory network to coordinate synchronized development of adjacent tissues.</p>

        <title>Spinal motor neurons shift position relative to adjacent notochord cells during axonogenesis</title>
        <p>Motoneuron cell bodies of the peripheral nervous system reside in the spinal cord while their axons extend into adjacent tissues. Differences in growth rates and hence shifts between the spinal cord relative to adjacent tissues has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref003">3</xref>], however if and to what extent this process overlaps with the time period when motor axons exit from the spinal cord and migrate through adjacent tissues has not been examined. We used time-lapse imaging to track the position of identified motoneurons relative to that of adjacent tissues during development. In zebrafish, the earliest developing motorneurons, the ventrally projecting caudal primary (CaP) motoneurons begin axonogenesis at around 16–18 hours post fertilization (hpf), and their axons exit the spinal cord at segmental exit points shortly thereafter between 17–19 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref013">13</xref>]. Over the next 10 hours motor axons pioneer a ventral path, migrating between the adjacent notochord and myotome through an environment rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by both notochord and muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref014">14</xref>]. Time-lapse analysis starting at 22 hpf revealed that as GFP labeled CaP motor axons pioneer the ventral path, notochord cells expand and progressively shift caudally relative to the position of individual CaP motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1A–1G</xref>). This shift occurred initially at a rate of 3.6 ± 0.43 μm/hour and increased over time to a rate of up to 8.9 ± 2.6 μm/hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Over a 14 hour time period this resulted in a significant shift (98.6 ± 5.0 μm) between individual CaP neurons and notochord cells. Concomitantly with this posterior shift, the diameter of individual notochord cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1C–1E</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">1F</xref>), reflecting the process of vacuole inflation and expansion within notochord cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref015">15</xref>].</p>

        <p>(A-D) Time-lapse of a developing zebrafish embryo with transgenic expression of GFP in motoneurons (<italic>mnx1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>), starting at 22 hpf for 840 min. (A, B) Low magnification bright field images, generated by stitching together several images. (C, D) Higher magnification images of approximately the boxed areas in A (different embryos), in brightfield and GFP, generated by overlaying substacks containing motor neurons and notochord cells, respectively. While the embryo grows and axons are extending, there is a progressive posterior shift of an ‘identified’ notochord cell (outlined by dashed yellow circle) relative to a GFP positive CaP motoneuron (white asterisk). (E) Schematics of this shift. Note that as CaP motor axons (green) are extending and notochord cells (yellow dotted circle) shift posteriorly, the diameter of notochord cells increases, quantified in (F; n = 9). (G) Velocity of posterior shift of notochord cells relative to motor axons in μm/h over time (n = 6). Shift velocity is initially low and peaks between 210 and 630 min.

Note that an adjacent, GFP positive interneuron (+) and adjacent individual muscle fibers (white brackets) both stay aligned with the motoneuron. In contrast, individually labeled notochord cells (white arrow) shift progressively posteriorly compared to the labeled CaP motoneurons (n = 8/8).

        <p>Since this tissue shift has not been previously been documented in zebrafish, we used more definitive cellular markers to further characterize this process. To that end, we labeled individual CaP motoneuron using <italic>mnx1</italic>:<italic>mKate</italic> in <italic>Evx1</italic>:<italic>Gal4; UAS</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> transgenic embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref016">16</xref>]. In these embryos, interneurons and occasionally notochord and myotomal muscle cells are labeled with GFP, allowing singly labeled motoneurons to be traced over time in relation to singly labeled notochord and muscle cells. Time-lapse analyses confirmed a significant shift between CaP neurons and GFP positive notochord cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1H–1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006440.s001">S1 Movie</xref>). Importantly, the position of cell bodies of individual GFP positive interneurons relative to CaP cell bodies stayed constant, suggesting that the entire spinal cord shifts relative to the adjacent notochord (n = 8/8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1H–1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006440.s001">S1 Movie</xref>). In contrast to notochord cells, myotomal muscle cells stayed aligned with CaP motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1H–1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006440.s001">S1 Movie</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the shift between individual CaP motoneurons and adjacent notochord cells. Despite this dramatic shift between the spinal cord and adjacent tissues, individual CaP cell bodies remained well aligned with their axons, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to prevent a shift between motoneuron cell bodies and their axons.</p>

        <title><italic>Mypt1</italic> myosin phosphatase mutants exhibit motoneuron defects</title>
        <p>To define genetic entry points into how motoneurons compensate for tissue shifts we examined a collection of mutants with defects in neuromuscular connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref017">17</xref>].

To identify the causative mutation underlying the <italic>p82emcf</italic> phenotype, we employed a positional cloning strategy and mapped the mutation to a ~350 kb region on chromosome 4, which contains three annotated genes. Genomic and cDNA sequencing revealed a non-sense mutation in one of the three genes encoding the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, <bold><italic>p</italic></bold>rotein <bold><italic>p</italic></bold>hos<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>hatase <bold><italic>1</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>r</italic></bold>egulatory subunit <bold><italic>12a</italic></bold> (<bold><italic>ppp1r12a</italic></bold>) commonly known as <italic>mypt1</italic>. <italic>Mypt1</italic> acts as a binding platform by assembling the regulatory and catalytic subunits of the myosin phosphatase complex, and by recruiting substrates such as phosphorylated myosin II, to the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref019">19</xref>].

While myosin II activation via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref020">20</xref>] are well known to regulate motoneuron development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref022">22</xref>], the role of myosin phosphatase in motoneuron development has not been examined in great detail.

        <p>The <italic>mypt1</italic> C1316A mutation introduces a premature stop after 438 amino acids, thereby severely truncating the wildtype protein (1049aa) and deleting key phosphorylation residues as well as the binding site for the regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref019">19</xref>]. The truncated mutant protein is likely to severely reduce or abolish myosin phosphatase activity, predicted to significantly enhance myosin II activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref026">26</xref>]. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the truncated mutant protein can act as a dominant negative version of <italic>mypt1</italic> when overexpressed, heterozygous <italic>p82emcf</italic> embryos do not display obvious motoneuron defects. To confirm that the mutation in <italic>mypt1</italic> causes the <italic>p82emcf</italic> mutant phenotype, we performed mRNA rescue experiments. One-cell stage embryos were injected with wildtype <italic>mypt1</italic> mRNA, and embryos were scored at 26 hpf for motor axon defects.

        <p>To determine whether mutations in <italic>mypt1</italic> indeed increase or prolong myosin II activity in zebrafish embryos, we examined the phosphorylation status of a myosin phosphatase substrate, phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref018">18</xref>]. <italic>Mypt1</italic> is widely expressed in the zebrafish embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref023">23</xref>], and at 25 hpf <italic>mypt1</italic> mRNA and p-MLC are both readily detectable in slow-twitch skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>).

Furthermore, expression of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based biosensor for myosin light chain phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref027">27</xref>] in individual muscle cells confirmed that in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants myosin light chain phosphorylation is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2I–2K</xref>).

        <p>We initially identified <italic>mypt1</italic> (<italic>p82emcf</italic>) mutants on the basis of a strong motor axonal phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref017">17</xref>].

To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed single cell labeling of individual primary motor neurons. We focused our analysis on ventrally projecting CaP motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref012">12</xref>].

        <p>We next asked whether <italic>mypt1</italic> acts within motoneurons or in their environment to restrict excessive axonal branching. Chimera analysis revealed that wildtype-derived motoneurons when transplanted into <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant hosts displayed the excessive branching phenotype characteristic for mutants (n = 7/11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

Thus, <italic>mypt1</italic> suppresses excessive axonal branching through a cell non-autonomous mechanism. We have previously shown that in zebrafish a distinct subset of muscle cells, the slow-twitch or adaxial muscle cells delineate the future motor axonal path, and that they provide cues critical for motor axon guidance and branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref032">32</xref>].

        <p>Given that <italic>mypt1</italic> controls CaP axon branching through a cell non-autonomous mechanism, we wondered whether such mechanism also controls CaP migration/positioning. Chimera analyses revealed that CaP neurons derived from wildtype or heterozygous siblings transplanted into wildtype hosts were mostly correctly positioned (95%, n = 57/60), while cell bodies of <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant motoneurons transplanted into wildtype hosts were frequently shifted rostrally relative to the axon exit point (n = 5/16, p = 0.0087). Thus, chimera analyses demonstrate that unlike axonal branching, CaP migration/positioning requires <italic>mypt1</italic> function intrinsically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that in the early zebrafish embryo activation of myosin II or <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown induces cell-autonomous membrane blebbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref038">38</xref>]. In fact, using a transgenic line expressing a membrane tagged fluorophore in motoneurons to monitor CaP membrane dynamics, we find that at 18–19 hpf <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant compared to wildtype CaP motoneurons exhibited excessive membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). To demonstrate that this blebbing was indeed caused by enhanced myosin II activity, we treated embryos with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. Blebbistatin treatment abolished membrane blebbing in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>). Furthermore, blebbistatin treatment restored proper positioning of CaP motoneurons in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4J and 4K</xref>), further supporting the notion that enhanced myosin II activity causes neuronal mispositioning. Increased blebbing and mispositioning can be caused by a reduction in cell adhesion, and consistent with this notion, myosin II is central in the control of cell adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref040">40</xref>].

Thus, loss of <italic>mypt1</italic> function in CaP motoneurons leads to increased myosin II activity which in turn causes excessive membrane blebbing, reduced N-cadherin positive cell-cell contacts and aberrant cell body positioning. However, if and to which extent the reduction of N-cadherin positive cell-cell contacts on motoneuron contributes to the cell migration defects observed in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants remains unclear.</p>

        <p>Given that excessive membrane blebbing was detectable already at 16 hpf, we next asked whether <italic>mypt1</italic> is required for CaP’s initial migration towards the segmental axon exit point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. For this we performed time-lapse analyses of fluorescently labeled CaP motoneurons from the time of their first appearance in the ventral spinal cord (~16 hpf), through the time period when CaP axons navigate the space outside the spinal cord between the adjacent notochord and somitic muscle cells, up to the point when axons reached the ventral extent of the myotome (~29 hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This revealed that at the onset of axonogenesis, <italic>mypt1</italic> CaP somata like those in wildtype were positioned just above the segmental exit point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), suggesting that in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants the initial migration of CaP motoneurons towards the segmental exit point is unaffected.

        <title>Live cell imaging reveals fine-tuning of motoneuron position to compensate for tissue shifts</title>
        <p>Similar to other vertebrates, spinal motoneurons in zebrafish develop in register with and thus localize to the same anterior-posterior level as the muscle they innervate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref037">37</xref>]. Our live cell imaging revealed a pronounced shift between spinal motoneurons and adjacent mesodermal notochord cells. Such differential or ‘allometric’ growth of the spinal cord relative to mesodermal derivatives has been previously documented in mammalian and human embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref042">42</xref>]. What had not been previously appreciated is that these tissue movements occur during the time period when motor axons have already exited from the spinal cord and migrate through extracellular space between the adjacent notochord and somite muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Shifting spinal cord positions relative to adjacent tissues through which motor axons extend is predicted to generate significant mechanical tension between motoneuron soma and their axon, thus necessitating a compensatory mechanisms to keep both aligned and in register.</p>
        <p>In zebrafish, the initial migration of spinal motoneurons ceases just before the onset of axon initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. Here, we identify a second period of motoneuron position fine-tuning at a time when axons have already exited from the spinal cord to innervate their muscle targets. Based on loss of function phenotypes, the early migration requires Semaphorin-Neuropilin but is independent of <italic>mypt1</italic>, while the late fine-tuning appears independent of Semaphorin-Neuropilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref036">36</xref>], but requires <italic>mypt1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Thus, <italic>mypt1</italic>-dependent fine-tuning of motoneuron position defines a previously unknown mechanism to compensate for morphogenetic tissue movements between the spinal cord and adjacent tissues that occur well after the onset of axonogenesis.</p>

For many of these processes <italic>mypt1</italic> has been shown to act cell-autonomously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref046">46</xref>], while a cell non-autonomous function for <italic>mypt1</italic> has been reported during zebrafish gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref038">38</xref>]. Similarly, we find that <italic>mypt1</italic> acts cell non-autonomously to suppress exuberant axonal branching, possibly through myosin II as we detect increased p-MLC activity in slow-twitch skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2F–2K</xref>), which during motor axon outgrowth delineate their migratory path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
        <p>Conversely, <italic>mypt1</italic> acts cell autonomously within motoneurons as cell bodies migrate posteriorly to stay aligned with their axons as they shift posteriorly with the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Motoneuron membrane blebbing and neuronal mispositioning in <italic>mypt1</italic> are both sensitive to the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin, demonstrating that <italic>mypt1</italic> regulates fine tuning of motoneuron position through myosin II-dependent actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Blebbistatin induces severe axonal branching, and thus precluded us to determine whether axonal branching is also regulated via a myosin II-dependent mechanism. Importantly, it is also possible that <italic>mypt1</italic> restricts axonal branching through a myosin II-independent mechanism. Besides regulating myosin II phosphorylation, the MYPT1-containing holoenzyme has also been shown to interact with a large host of putative substrates including moesin, tau, MAP2, Polo like kinase and the transcriptional repressor HDAC7, suggesting that <italic>mypt1</italic> likely has broader functions than myosin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref048">48</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>mypt1</italic> has recently been shown to interact with the insulin receptor substrate-1, and to regulate other pathways including mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether <italic>mypt1</italic> restricts axonal branching through a ‘canonical’ pathway such as myosin II or moesin phosphorylation, or through one of these recently identified substrates and pathways.</p>

        <title>Mypt1-dependent motoneuron positioning during notochord driven axis elongation</title>
        <p>Our analyses of <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants uncover a second period of motoneuron migration during the time period when axons grow outside the spinal cord towards their muscle targets, and when the embryo elongates along its anterior-posterior axis. In zebrafish the driving force for axis elongation is thought to be at least in part caused by changes in notochord cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref015">15</xref>]. The notochord, which is the defining feature of chordates consists of an outer epithelial-like cell layer and an rod like core of cells each containing a single large vacuole that eventually occupies most of the cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref051">51</xref>]. As the vacuoles inflate and expand within the cells, the ECM sheath secreted from the outer cell layer restricts radial expansion of the notochord resulting in the elongation along the anterior-posterior axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref052">52</xref>]. Importantly, vacuole inflation coincides with the time period when we observe the shift between identified spinal motoneurons and notochord cells relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1A–1G</xref>). Notochord vacuoles have been reported in several vertebrate embryos including in mammalian embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref053">53</xref>], and recent work in zebrafish has identified vacuole acidification and <italic>rab32</italic> mediated endosomal trafficking to be critical for vacuole expansion and body axis elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>Notochord cells secrete large amounts of ECM that serves as the substratum for migrating motor axons once they exit from the spinal cord. As notochord cells shift caudal, their ECM might ‘drag’ motor axons along caudally, thereby generating tension between the axons and their cell bodies in the spinal cord. It is conceivable that this tension induces <italic>mypt1</italic> function, which acts in motorneurons to fine-tune their position, thereby compensating for the caudal shift of their axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4</xref>). How then does <italic>mypt1</italic> fine-tune motoneuron position? We show that inhibiting myosin II activity via blebbistatin restores motoneuron fine-tuning in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutants, providing compelling evidence that <italic>mypt1</italic> modulates actomyosin contractility within motoneurons. Our findings thus implicate the myosin II regulatory network, including myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref020">20</xref>] as key modulators to adjust motoneuron position during axonogenesis. It will be interesting to determine whether notochord expansion coordinates <italic>mypt1</italic>-dependent motoneuron positioning through mechanical forces or changes in gene expression.</p>
        <p>Finally, given that tissue shifts of the spinal cord relative to mesodermal derivatives have previously been documented in mammalian embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref042">42</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that <italic>mypt1</italic>-dependent compensation for such shifts might be a conserved feature of development. In fact loss of <italic>mypt1</italic> in mice leads to embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006440.ref054">54</xref>], consistent with a potential role in tissue shift compensation.</p>

        <p>Fixed and stained embryos mounted in Vectashield (Vector laboratories) were imaged using either a spinning disk (Olympus) or using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM710). Maximum intensity projection images of z-stacks were created using Slidebook (3i) or Image J (NIH) software. Live embryos were mounted in 0.7–0.8% agarose in E3 and anesthetized in 0.022% tricaine and kept at 28°C. For quantification of FRET efficiency, donor emission was determined using ZEN software (Zeiss) in a single muscle fiber (region of interest) in which the acceptor was bleached. FRET efficiency was calculated as the ratio of donor emission before minus after acceptor bleaching divided by the emission after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2I–2K</xref>). Confocal images were further processed and analyzed using the Image J software package (NIH). Image manipulations included adjustment of brightness, contrast, gamma-value, background substraction. Manipulations were always applied to the entire image and to all images in one experiment ensuring that the content of the image wasn't altered. Images were exported and further processed in Photoshop CS4 and final versions of the figures for the manuscript were prepared using Illustrator CS4 and Photoshop CS4 (Adobe). To visualize the entire growing embryo in brightfield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), several separate maximum projection images were stitched together using Image J (NIH). For better visualization of the notochord cells in brightfield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), we generated separate substacks, one containing the motor neurons on one side of the fish (GFP) and the other containing the notochord cells (brightfield), generated maximum intensity projection images, merged the channels using Image J (NIH) and used the unsharp mask filter in Illustrator CS4 (Adobe). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, a 3D project of a 36 μm substack was generated in Image J (NIH) and a slightly turned view is shown. For quantification of anti-phospho-myosin light chain 2 staining compared to F59 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2F–2H</xref>), we processed all embryos in the same tube during antibody staining, and always imaged the same hemisegments; substacks of 40 μm were subjected to a z-projection (slice summation) and integrated densities were determined after splitting the two channels. For anti-phospho-myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC) staining, outliers were removed to reduce noise using Image J (NIH). Values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2H</xref> represent the ratio of p-MLC/ F59 relative to the ratio in wildtype sibling embryos. For better visualization of the dynamic range, p-MLC signal and SECFP channel for FRET were changed to a thermal color scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g002">Fig 2F', 2G', 2I and 2I'</xref>). N-Cadherin colocalization with the neuronal membrane marker mCD8-GFP was determined using the colocalization tool within Imaris software (Bitplane). Colocalized pixels were pseudocolored by the software to help visualizing colocalization and colocalization was quantified as the percentage of the green channel volume above threshold which is colocalized with the red channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006440.g004">Fig 4L–4N</xref>).

        <p>(A, B) Immunostaining for Engrailed-1 (En1, red) and axonal Znp1 (green) at 26 hpf in wildtype (A) and <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos (B), showing normal localization of En1 positive elongated nuclei of adaxial muscle cells in the anterior somites (anterior of the motor axons, arrowheads). This indicates normal specification and polarity of adaxial muscle cells in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos. (C, D) Staining with bungarotoxin (BTX, red) and for axonal Znp1 (green) at 26 hpf in wildtype (C) and <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos (D), showing normal sites of postsynaptic differentiation in muscle cells directly opposing motor axons. This indicates normal muscle fiber differentiation in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos. (E-H) Immunostaining for myosin heavy chain in adaxial muscle cells (F59, red) at 26 hpf in wildtype (E) and <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos (F), showing irregular spacing of muscle cells (stars) and shorter muscle cells in <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant embryos. Quantification of muscle fiber length at 18 hpf and 26 hpf (G) showing that <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant muscle cells have normal length initially, but fail to grow over time. Quantification of sarcomere length at 26 hpf (H) as determined by the interval of myosin heavy chain rich A-bands, showing that the reduced muscle cell length is not caused by sarcomere shortening, but rather by reduced addition of new sarcomeres.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>Two stimuli alternately presented at different locations can evoke a percept of a stimulus continuously moving between the two locations. The neural mechanism underlying this apparent motion (AM) is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path, although evidence remains inconclusive. AM masking, which refers to the reduced detectability of stimuli along the AM path, has been taken as evidence for AM-related V1 activation. AM-induced neural responses are thought to interfere with responses to physical stimuli along the path and as such impair the perception of these stimuli. However, AM masking can also be explained by predictive coding models, predicting that responses to stimuli presented on the AM path are suppressed when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. In the present study, we find that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. This masking is strongest when the target orientation is identical to the orientation of the inducers. We developed a V1-like population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model. We find that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to either cause masking or to be perceived as motion. Our model instead predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Two spatially separate stimuli presented in rapid succession often induce the illusory perception of a moving stimulus (apparent motion or AM). Its underlying mechanism is thought to be increased activation in primary visual cortex representing the motion path. Indirect evidence for this account comes from the reduced detectability of stimuli presented along the motion path (AM masking). Here, we developed a computational model of AM-related effects on visual processing in early visual cortex, which predicted a neural activation that is too small to either account for the observed masking or the perception of motion. Instead, our model predicts strong suppression of neural responses to stimuli presented along the motion path, especially when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. Our findings support predictive coding models of visual processing, in which higher-level predictions about motion explain away lower-level responses to expected sensory input.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Apparent motion (AM) is a type of illusory motion that can be perceived when two stimuli are presented alternately at two different locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref001">1</xref>]. Under optimal spatial and temporal stimulus conditions, observers can perceive a single stimulus moving continuously along a path between the two locations. Some studies found neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) to respond during AM as if the stimulus was physically present at intermediate locations along the AM path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref003">3</xref>]. It has been claimed that humans perceive AM because of these V1 responses, indicating that AM has an early cortical locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref003">3</xref>]. AM-related V1 responses may be the result of feedback from higher visual areas involved in motion (MT/V5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref006">6</xref>] or form processing (anterior temporal lobe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref008">8</xref>]. However, evidence for the neural mechanism underlying AM remains inconclusive. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref009">9</xref>] failed to find AM-related activity in primary visual cortex during the percept of moving concentric rings. These authors did find increased responses in motion processing areas, suggesting that AM has a late cortical locus. Other studies report a similar lack of activation in V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Behavioral studies have supported the hypothesis of AM-related activation in V1 by reporting impaired perception of stimuli presented along the path of AM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref014">14</xref>]. For instance, Hidaka et al. induced an AM percept using Gabor gratings of a specific orientation. They observed that detectability of a target grating was impaired along the AM path, but only when the orientation of the target matched the orientation of the AM-inducing gratings. This AM masking has been explained by perceptual filling-in at the level of V1. The presentation of the AM inducers evokes responses in a subset of V1 cells, tuned to locations along the AM path and to the visual properties of these inducers. These evoked responses interfere with the responses to actual stimuli along the AM path, thus impairing the perception of these stimuli.</p>
        <p>However, AM masking does not necessarily imply V1 activation. An alternative view on AM masking can be provided by a predictive coding account of visual processing. Predictive coding emphasizes the notion of a “predictive brain” generating predictions about incoming information based on the surrounding context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref016">16</xref>]. Activation in higher-level visual areas represent the generated prediction based on lower-level input, while lower-level responses represent the mismatch between sensory and predicted input (i.e., prediction error). Predictive signals from higher-level areas are sent back to lower-level areas to reduce prediction error by suppressing sensory signals that can be expected based on the higher-level hypothesis. Presumably, early visual areas receive inhibitory feedback from the motion areas hMT/V5+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref006">6</xref>]. Several physiological studies have indeed demonstrated that sensory signals which can be predicted from their surrounding motion context evoke smaller responses in V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
        <p>AM stimuli may provide such a predictable motion context. A stimulus presented on the AM path can be considered predictable when (1) its features match those of the apparently moving stimulus and (2) the stimulus appears at a time and place that is consistent with the perceived motion. According to predictive coding models, responses to stimuli presented along the AM path will be suppressed in early visual brain areas such as V1, but only when they are predictable. Using fMRI, Alink et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref017">17</xref>] confirm this claim, reporting reduced V1 responses to a stimulus during AM only when this stimulus appeared at the expected time and place along the AM path. Interestingly, AM-induced masking seems to be consistent with this kind of suppression. Indeed, Hidaka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref013">13</xref>] report that masking of a target grating presented on the AM path only occurs when the target orientation matches that of the apparently moving grating. Presumably, observers perceiving the apparent movement of a horizontal grating expect to see a horizontal but not a vertical grating in the middle of the AM path. V1 responses to a horizontal target grating are therefore predictable and consequently suppressed, while V1 responses to a vertical target grating are unaffected.</p>
        <p>In summary, it is at present unclear whether AM masking is the result of V1 activation or suppression. In the present study, we use computational modeling to uncover the actual cause of AM masking, thereby revealing the effects of AM on early visual processing. Similar to Hidaka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref013">13</xref>], we used grating inducers to create an AM percept and find masking of a target grating along the AM path. If AM masking is indeed the result of activation in lower-level visual areas such as V1, this masking can be considered to be a special case of pattern masking. In a typical pattern masking study, a target grating has to be detected against a stationary background grating. When the contrast of the background grating is sufficiently high, the target grating is masked. Pattern masking is typically attributed to activation at the level of V1. The background grating evokes a response in V1 cells, and this response can interfere with the response to the target grating. Contrast normalization models provide an excellent account of pattern masking, explaining how activation in low-level stages of visual processing leads to masking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref022">22</xref>]. If AM indeed induces V1 activation, in line with the early filling-in hypothesis, and if that activation is the sole cause of AM masking, a normalization model should be able to account for this masking.</p>
        <p>We developed a V1-like population code model by extending a standard contrast normalization model to include effects of AM. We find that this model cannot account for our results when incorporating only AM-related activation. The amount of activation predicted by the model is too small to be perceived by our observers and does not cause significant masking. Instead, a model incorporating strong suppression of responses to stimuli on the AM path captures the observed masking effects, arguing in favour of predictive coding theory.</p>

        <p>We measured the effect of perceiving AM on the detection of a target grating in a spatial two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. In the AM condition, two alternately presented grating stimuli induced a strong percept of AM along a vertical path at both sides of the screen. The target grating was presented either at the left or right side, in the middle of the path. In a Flicker control condition, the two inducers appeared simultaneously, which disrupted the motion percept entirely. Grating contrast and the difference between target and inducer orientation were varied systematically (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g001">Fig 1A</xref> for an illustration of part of the trial sequence in the AM condition).</p>

        <p>When the target orientation matched the orientation of the inducers, strong masking was observed during AM. Observers failed to reach a high detection performance in the AM condition, even when grating contrast was high. The maximum performance is captured by the psychometric function via 1 − <italic>λ</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>) and was estimated at 83% on average across observers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The difference in maximum performance between AM and Flicker condition was significant (average <italic>λ</italic> difference = 16%, parametric bootstrap, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all observers after Bonferroni correction). The position of the psychometric function along the contrast axis did not significantly differ between the AM and Flicker condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows the data of a typical observer when target orientation was identical to the orientation of the inducers. As all observers displayed similar patterns, we pooled the data across observers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005155.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The pooled data set will be used in the remainder of this study.</p>
        <p>
        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g002">Fig 2</xref> displays the psychometric functions fitted to the pooled data for each orientation level. AM masking appears to be tuned for orientation: the observed masking in the AM condition decreased when the orientation difference between target and inducers increased. This is also evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g003">Fig 3</xref>, which shows the maximum performance level (1 − <italic>λ</italic>) as a function of the orientation difference for the AM and Flicker condition. Maximum performance (1 − <italic>λ</italic>) in the AM condition increased significantly when the difference between target and inducer orientation was increased from 0° to 45° (linear regression slope = 0.0028, parametric bootstrap, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In the Flicker condition however, performance was constant in the 0°–45° range (linear regression slope = -0.0001, parametric bootstrap, <italic>p</italic> = 0.865).

        <title>Population code model of AM-induced effects</title>
        <p>We developed a V1-like population code model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>), based on the contrast normalization model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>], to incorporate AM-induced effects on low-level visual processing. In our model, the effects of AM on the encoding of a target grating can potentially occur in three different ways (for a schematic overview, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g004">Fig 4</xref>). First, AM can cause excitation by “filling-in” activation along the AM path. More specifically, AM can induce a response in neurons sensitive to the inducer orientation. Second, AM can inhibit responses in the neural population by exciting the gain control pool and hence causing normalization. It should be noted that the excitatory and inhibitory AM effects mimic the excitation and inhibition that would be observed in the case of real motion. In other words, the neural population responds “as if” the inducer was actually moving along the AM path, in accordance with a “filling-in” account of AM. A third way AM can affect the population response is by reducing the response gain of neurons sensitive to the inducer orientation. In this case, the maximum response is reduced as the entire contrast response function is rescaled to lower response rates. We consider such a suppressive effect because of our finding that AM reduces maximum performance and that a rescaled psychometric function is required to capture this observation. Note that, in this study, AM-induced effects refer to effects caused by the inducers during the AM sequence, presumably via feedback from motion areas, and not necessarily caused by the conscious percept of AM.</p>

        <title>Schematic overview of possible AM-induced effects in the contrast normalization model.</title>
        <p>Following the standard contrast normalization model, the target grating in our task is encoded by a population of V1-like neurons tuned to orientation, which are subject to response acceleration and divisive inhibition. This standard model is extended by including the effects of AM, which can modify the encoding of gratings in our model in three ways. (1) AM can excite linear receptive fields sensitive to the orientation of the inducers controlled by <italic>α</italic>, evoking responses as if the inducer was physically present at the target location (as during real motion). This would correspond to a “filling-in” process along the AM path. (2) AM can induce divisive normalization via <italic>β</italic> by exciting neurons in the gain control pool tuned to the orientation of the inducers. A similar divisive normalization signal would be observed when the inducer would be positioned at the target location. As such, AM-induced inhibition is also in accordance with a “filling-in” account of AM. (3) AM can scale down the contrast response functions due to the suppressive effect exerted by neurons tuned to the inducers’ orientation via <italic>γ</italic>.</p>

        <title>Response suppression during AM</title>
        <p>Maximum-likelihood fitting provided the optimal parameter estimates of our model. Most estimates are well within the range of values reported in physiological V1 single-cell recording studies in monkeys or cats. The semi-saturation contrast was estimated at 9.65%. A similar value has been reported in a physiologically plausible population code model of human contrast processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref025">25</xref>]. The spontaneous background activity equalled 4.55% of the maximal response, matching reports of Geisler and Albrecht [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref026">26</xref>]. The concentration parameter <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub>, controlling the bandwidth of excitatory (Von Mises) orientation tuning functions, was estimated at 1.35 (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [0.93, 3.52]). This corresponds to an orientation bandwidth at half-height of 41.92° (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [25.62°, 51.17°]), in agreement with observed bandwidths of V1 orientation tuning functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref027">27</xref>]. The response exponent <italic>p</italic>, determining the degree of non-linear response expansion, was estimated at 5.52. This is a relatively high value in comparison with physiological findings (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Discussion</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref028">28</xref>]. Our efficiency parameter <italic>ϵ</italic> was estimated at 67%. As noted previously, the exact value of the efficiency parameter may reflect a wide range of possible factors which merely affect absolute performance and do not mediate AM-specific masking.</p>
        <p>Possible effects underlying AM in our model are excitation, inhibition through divisive normalization and response gain suppression, controlled by <italic>α</italic>, <italic>β</italic>, and <italic>γ</italic>, respectively. AM induces significant excitation: <italic>α</italic> was estimated at 1.17% (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [0.62%, 1.68%]). AM also causes significant inhibition, as estimated by <italic>β</italic> which equalled 1.51% (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [1.20%, 2.06%]). Importantly, AM-induced excitation and inhibition have only a limited effect on the contrast response functions and, consequently, on detection performance. To demonstrate the contribution of excitation and inhibition to masking, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the predictions of the model for the case in which <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> were set to zero after model fitting. It can be seen that the model still predicts a considerable amount of masking when AM-induced excitation and inhibition are removed. The reason is that masking is mainly caused by response gain suppression in our model. <italic>γ</italic> equalled 64.4% (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [56.4%, 76.5%]), indicating that the contrast response function in the presence of AM is scaled down by a factor of (100 − 64.4)% = 35.6%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the predictions of the best fitting model in which <italic>γ</italic> was set to zero after fitting. Not only is masking significantly reduced at high contrast levels, at low contrast levels the model predicts facilitation. In other words, detection performance is predicted to be better in the AM condition compared to the Flicker condition when target grating contrast is low. This facilitation effect was not present in the data. In agreement with the predictions of the logistic psychometric function model, the population code model predicts that performance in the AM condition is always lower than in the Flicker condition, also at lower contrast levels. To further test whether a model including only excitation and inhibition could account for our results, we refitted the model without suppression (<italic>γ</italic> was constrained to zero before fitting). The AIC of this model was significantly worse than the AIC of our full model including suppression (AIC difference = 212.62, parametric bootstrap, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating that the latter provided a better fit to the data.</p>

        <title>AM-induced effects are tuned to orientation</title>
        <p>The effects induced by AM in our model are selective to orientation. More specifically, the size of the AM effects on a neuron decreases as the difference between the neuron’s preferred orientation and the inducer orientation increases. For AM-induced excitation as well as response gain suppression, the tuning functions have an orientation bandwidth equal to the bandwidth of the neurons’ excitatory receptive fields, as evident from the fact that the concentration parameters <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> are equal. Their value of 1.35 (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [0.81, 2.00]) corresponds to an orientation bandwidth at half-height of 41.92° (95%<italic>CI</italic> = [54.98°, 34.22°]). AM thus only affects neurons sensitive to the inducer orientation, with an orientation precision that matches the orientation selectivity of typical V1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref029">29</xref>]. The bandwidth concentration parameter of the tuning function for the AM-induced inhibition was estimated at 0.001. This small value implies that inhibition is not tuned for the inducer orientation and is consistent with a broadly tuned gain control pool. To examine whether a model which allows no orientation tuning of the AM-evoked effects could also account for our data, we compared the AIC of our model with the AIC of a model in which <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>inh</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> are fixed at 0.001 before fitting.

        <title>Eye movements are not the cause of AM masking</title>
        <p>Note that observers were instructed not to move their eyes and maintain fixation on the centre of the screen throughout the entire trial duration. It is however possible that observers did not follow these instructions and that the observed AM-induced effects can be explained by systematic differences in eye movement patterns between the AM and Flicker condition. We therefore conducted a control experiment in which three observers performed the contrast detection task while eye movements were recorded (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005155.s002">S2 Text</xref>).</p>
        <p>Observers were found to be highly successful in maintaining fixation on the cross in the centre of the screen. For one observer, significant differences in fixation behavior were observed between the Flicker and AM condition. These small differences however could not account for the observed AM-induced masking. Our population code model was able to account for this masking effect and parameter estimates were highly similar compared to the estimates obtained in the main experiment. The modeling results show that all AM-induced effects found in the main experiment were present and equally strong in the control experiment. In summary, eye movements do not seem to play a role in AM masking nor in the underlying AM-induced effects on early sensory responses.</p>

        <title>Early response suppression instead of perceptual filling-in during AM</title>
        <p>In the present study, we examined the underlying neural effects of AM on low-level visual processing. To this end, we investigated how AM influences the detection of grating stimuli presented along the AM path. We found that AM impairs the detection of a target presented on the AM path when the target’s orientation matches the inducers’ orientation. A previous study reporting AM masking measured detection performance at a single stimulus intensity level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref013">13</xref>]. We evaluated detection performance across a wide range of grating contrast levels in order to obtain full psychometric functions. This allowed us to discover that perceiving AM imposes an upper bound on performance, which cannot be exceeded by raising the contrast level of the target grating.</p>
        <p>We applied a V1-like population code model, based on contrast normalization, and found that this model provides an excellent account of the data, predicting the AM-induced upper bound on performance. Importantly, the model reveals that AM masking is not caused by excitation but by suppression of responses to stimuli along the AM path, through a reduction in response gain. In fact, when this suppressive effect is removed from our model, masking disappears and the model even predicts facilitation. This is related to the well-known pedestal effect, which refers to the observation that the presence of a background grating can facilitate the detection of a superimposed target grating at low background contrasts. The pedestal effect has been attributed to the fact that the background grating evokes a small level of activation in V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref021">21</xref>]. Due to this activation, target detection operates on a steeper part of the V1 contrast response functions, leading to larger differential responses. According to our model, the AM-induced activation also acts as a pedestal, improving detection performance. This facilitation effect does not show up in the data due to the strong suppressive effect of AM. The results of a control experiment rule out the possibility that eye movements were responsible for the observed masking or AM effects on early sensory responses.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have claimed that human observers perceive motion when viewing an AM display because of filling-in of V1 activation along the AM path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref013">13</xref>]. This perceptual filling-in would imply that AM is (at least partly) represented at the level of V1. Our results suggest that AM-induced activation is too small to be perceptually relevant. A grating on the AM path evoking the same level of excitation as the level of AM-induced activation predicted by our model would not be detectable. Consequently, AM would most likely not be perceived if it was only represented in this small amount of V1 activation. The AM-evoked excitation can thus hardly be considered as an instance of perceptual filling-in. This result provides strong support for the hypothesis that the AM percept is due to activation at a later processing stage.</p>
        <p>However, it is at present not clear which higher-level brain areas are involved in the representation of AM. Some neuroimaging studies indicate that the motion area hMT/V5+ plays an important role in the perception of AM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref010">10</xref>]. This area contains neurons selective to motion direction with large receptive fields, which seems necessary for an AM percept occurring over a relatively large distance (i.e., 8° in our study). Such type of perceived motion has been contrasted with short-range AM (i.e., motion occurring over a limited spatial and temporal range), which has been hypothesized to be represented at lower levels of the visual processing hierarchy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref031">31</xref>]. However, single-cell recording studies in nonhuman primates have failed to find a representation of long-range motion in MT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref034">34</xref>]. Instead, MT neurons responded only to short-range motion even when long-range motion was perceptually dominant. Moreover, other findings suggest that the visual ventral pathway, which is important for shape processing, is involved in the representation of AM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref008">8</xref>]. Irrespective of where AM is represented in the brain, our results suggest that neurons responding to AM will activate a mechanism that ultimately leads to response suppression in early visual areas.</p>
        <p>The response gain reduction predicted by our model was strongest when the target matches the orientation of the motion-inducing stimuli. This orientation tuning of AM-induced suppression is implemented in the model by rescaling the effects of AM on a given neuron with the selectivity of that neuron to the inducers. AM thus only affects neurons that are selective for the inducers’ orientation. It should be noted that, due to our stimulus design, detection performance for a horizontal target grating was always worse than for a vertical grating in the AM condition. The degraded detection performance for a horizontal grating in the AM condition could be due to a difference between the Flicker and AM condition in preferred direction of eye movements. The control experiment ruled out this alternative explanation.</p>

        <title>AM-induced effects occur in the early visual cortex</title>
        <p>AM most likely modulates sensory responses in the early visual cortex. Evidence for this claim comes from the fact that the response properties of the neurons assumed in our model’s encoding front-end are consistent with those of V1 neurons. All parameter estimates specifying the front-end match estimates reported by physiological studies of V1, with the exception of the response exponent <italic>p</italic>. The value of <italic>p</italic> was estimated at 5.52, which is higher than the value of 2 typically observed in V1. The large response exponent had to be assumed in the model to account for the large steepness of the psychometric functions. As such, the response exponent estimate does not only reflect the degree of V1 response acceleration but can also capture other factors contributing to psychometric function steepness which were not incorporated in our model to keep computations tractable (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>). Spatial uncertainty, for instance, has been found to increase the steepness of the psychometric function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref035">35</xref>]. Notably, spatial uncertainty is higher in the periphery compared to the fovea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref037">37</xref>]. In our experiment, the target was positioned relatively far in the periphery (i.e., 10°), making it possible that uncertainty contributed to the steepness of the psychometric functions. Importantly, it is unlikely that a possible increase in spatial uncertainty played any role in AM, as the slope of the psychometric functions did not differ between the AM and Flicker condition. A reduction in maximum performance, which is the key aspect of AM masking, has not been linked to spatial uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref036">36</xref>]. The large value of the response exponent is thus not inconsistent with the claim that the encoding front-end captures the responses of V1 neurons.</p>
        <p>Although a population code model of V1 is able to capture our results, we cannot rule out the possibility that AM-induced effects occur in other areas of the early visual cortex. Indeed, while multiple physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref039">39</xref>] as well as psychophysical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref040">40</xref>] studies have linked changes in contrast detection and discrimination performance to response changes in a V1 population of neurons, activity in areas V2 and V3 has also been found to correlate with decisions in contrast detection tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref041">41</xref>]. Even the majority of V4 neurons show monotonic sigmoidal contrast responses that can be characterised using parameter values largely similar to the ones we used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref042">42</xref>], especially in case of short stimulus presentation durations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the orientation tuning bandwidth estimates found in our study do argue against AM-induced suppression occurring in V4 and higher-level areas. The confidence interval of the <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> parameter has a relatively low upper bound of approximately 50°. In other words, our detection task mainly involved narrowly-tuned neurons, i.e., with a bandwidth (at half height) lower than 50°. While this value matches the estimates found for V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref027">27</xref>] and V2 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref044">44</xref>], the bandwidths found in higher-level areas are considerably larger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref029">29</xref>]. David, Hayden, and Gallant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref045">45</xref>], for instance, explicitly compare the orientation tuning bandwidth of individual V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref046">46</xref>] and V4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref047">47</xref>] neurons. They find that the majority of V4 cells have a bandwidth larger than 60°, with a median as large as 74.4°. The median for V1 cells equalled 43.7°, with a considerable amount of bandwidth values being smaller than 60° and, as such, part of the confidence interval estimated for our <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> parameter. Even though the distribution of tuning bandwidths observed in V1 is known to be broad, the average bandwidth is lower compared to the average bandwidth observed in higher visual areas. It is this average bandwidth that is captured by our model’s <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> parameter. The bandwidth estimate of the orientation tuning functions capturing AM-induced effects also matches the average bandwidth of V1 neurons, which again suggests a V1 locus of AM effects.</p>

        <title>Response suppression can be explained by predictive coding theory</title>
        <p>Our computational modeling results only provide a description of the suppressive effects of AM on responses in early visual cortex. Although such a description is interesting and useful in its own right, it does not explain why AM induces suppression. An explanation can be provided by predictive coding theory, which assumes that responses in low-level visual areas signaling prediction error are suppressed when they are consistent with the higher-level prediction of motion by a single stimulus along the AM path. Such an explanation is in accordance with other studies reporting reduced V1 activation for local features that fit their surrounding context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref049">49</xref>]. For instance, Alink et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref017">17</xref>] found that the predictability of stimuli in their surrounding AM context leads to reduced activation in V1. However, since the authors did not include a control Flicker condition, responses to a predictable stimulus in the context of AM could not be compared to those evoked by an unpredictable stimulus in the absence of AM. Our model predicts that responses to a physically present stimulus in the AM condition would be lower than those to a stimulus in the Flicker condition and that this suppression of responses to predictable sensory input is the main cause of AM masking. It should be noted that this is different from the paradigm used by Muckli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref003">3</xref>], in which no stimulus was present along the AM path and suppression of responses to such a stimulus could consequently not be measured.</p>
        <p>Stimulus predictability is a key element of the predictive coding framework, which claims that responses to a stimulus are suppressed only when the occurrence of those stimuli is predictable or expected. It should be noted that our manipulation of target grating orientation can be interpreted as a manipulation of the predictability of the target stimulus. Arguably, when viewing the apparent movement of a horizontal grating, observers may expect a horizontal target grating appearing in the middle of the AM path. The percept of this grating can be interpreted as being part of the motion percept: the apparently-moving horizontal grating is expected to pass by the middle of the AM path at the exact moment the target grating is presented. However, suppose we present a vertical target grating. This grating is presumably unexpected, as observers expect to see the horizontal grating passing by the middle of the AM path at the time the vertical grating is presented. By manipulating the target grating orientation in the present study, we induced both predictable as well as unpredictable responses in early visual cortex. We find that mainly the predictable responses, i.e., responses of neurons tuned to the predictable horizontal grating orientation are suppressed. As the orientation of the target grating deviates more from horizontal, the neurons responding to that grating are suppressed less. This finding supports the claim of predictive coding models that stimulus predictability leads to suppression.</p>
        <p>Suppression through response gain reduction is a multiplicative effect that can be implemented in a predictive coding framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref016">16</xref>]. Multiplicative or proportional scaling of responses of lower-level neurons has been reported by multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref051">51</xref>]. In addition, it has been found that GABA<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> inhibition controls response gain in V1, without affecting contrast gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref052">52</xref>]. It is possible that GABA<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> levels are selectively increased during AM. Indeed, GABA-mediated cortical inhibition has been linked to predictive coding in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
        <p>Although the predictive coding framework provides a functional explanation of our results, any other theory that predicts orientation-tuned AM-induced suppression can in principle account for these results. The descriptive nature of our population code model prevents us from providing direct evidence in favor of one particular theoretical framework. Our main contribution lies in the fact that we managed to use our descriptive model to reject the conclusions of multiple previous studies by uncovering a suppressive rather than facilitatory mechanism underlying AM. Any future theory of AM will have to account for this mechanism.</p>

        <title>Nature of AM-induced suppression</title>
        <p>In our model, V1 responses are inhibited during AM in two distinct ways, namely reduction in response gain and contrast gain (i.e., contrast sensitivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref054">54</xref>]. Contrast response functions were found to be rescaled to lower response rates during AM, indicating a decrease in response gain. At the same time, a gain control mechanism is activated during AM, which shifts the contrast response function to higher contrasts, thereby lowering contrast sensitivity. Importantly, the response gain effect is much larger than the change in contrast sensitivity. In addition, the change in response gain is much more narrowly tuned for the inducers’ orientation. This seems to suggest that the two forms of inhibition reflect different neural mechanisms. We believe that the response gain reduction is a direct consequence of AM because it is narrowly tuned. The change in contrast sensitivity seems to be a more indirect effect in that it may result from the activation of the gain control mechanism by the small AM-induced excitation. Indeed, it has often been found that the gain control mechanism is broadly tuned for orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref055">55</xref>]. Presumably, inhibition by neurons that are not sensitive to the inducers’ orientation results in weak AM masking to be still present in our data when the target and inducers are orthogonal. We incorporated response gain reduction in our model as a linear rescaling of the contrast response function similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref051">51</xref>], but other implementations may be possible. For instance, Rosenberg et al. implement a decrease in response gain via divisive normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref056">56</xref>]. More specifically, they assume an amplification of the normalization signal, which causes the contrast response functions to scale to lower response rates. This non-linear rescaling approximates the linear rescaling implemented in our model to a large degree. It is therefore possible that a model incorporating changes in divisive normalization during AM may account for the observed suppression. However, such a model would also have to predict the contrast gain reduction observed during AM in the present study. A contrast gain decrease corresponds to an additive increase of the normalization signal, whereas response gain reduction is realized through a multiplicative increase. Although it is possible that changes in the normalization mechanism are compound, consisting of both additive and multiplicative effects, previous studies have mainly reported additive changes leading to a change in contrast gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref020">20</xref>]. Our model therefore only incorporates additive changes in normalization during AM.</p>

        <title>Robustness of the population code model</title>
        <p>A highly similar version of our population code model, consisting of a physiologically plausible encoding front-end and a simple linear decoder, has been used previously by Putzeys et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>]. For the model to be considered robust, the parameter estimates obtained in the current study should be consistent with those reported by Putzeys et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>]. It should be noted that some of the parameters are poorly constrained by the data and their exact values are not critical. Differences in these values between current and previous studies should not be taken as evidence against the model. For instance, the spontaneous discharge rate was estimated at 4.55% in our study, but was poorly constrained in the Putzeys et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>]. The proportionality constant was poorly constrained in both studies. Only two of the well-constrained parameters estimates were different compared to the Putzeys et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>]. Firstly, the response exponent <italic>p</italic> was estimated at 5.52, which is higher than the physiologically plausible value of 2 used by Putzeys et al. Secondly, the estimated semi-saturation contrast <italic>c</italic><sub>50</sub> equalled 9.65% in the present study while Putzeys et al. reported a value of only 3%.</p>
        <p>As discussed earlier, we attribute the large response exponent to the high spatial uncertainty in the periphery compared to the fovea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref037">37</xref>]. While we presented targets in the periphery, Putzeys et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>] used a temporal 2AFC task with all stimuli being presented in the fovea. It is therefore likely that the amount of spatial uncertainty was lower in the latter study, which led to less steep psychometric functions and, consequently, a lower response exponent.</p>
        <p>The difference between foveal and peripheral grating presentation may also account for the difference in semi-saturation contrast. It is known that contrast sensitivity is lower in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref057">57</xref>]. The contrast sensitivity of a V1 neuron is determined by its semi-saturation contrast value. The high estimate of this value may simply reflect the low peripheral contrast sensitivity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that spatial attention can increase the contrast sensitivity of V1 neurons by lowering their semi-saturation contrast value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref040">40</xref>]. In the spatial 2AFC task of the current study, spatial attention had to be divided over two regions in the periphery, while in the temporal 2AFC task of Putzeys et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref024">24</xref>], attention could be fully directed to a single foveal region. This higher level of attention may have lowered the semi-saturation contrast.</p>

        <title>Possible extra-classical receptive field effects</title>
        <p>A possible issue concerns extra-classical receptive field effects operating at the level of V1, such as surround facilitation and suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref060">60</xref>]. These effects involve an increase (surround facilitation) or decrease (surround suppression) of the response gain of individual classical receptive fields by stimuli presented in their spatial surround [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref062">62</xref>]. Extra-classical receptive field effects may arise due to the size of our stimuli. The target grating stimulus to be detected in our task is relatively large, with a length and width equalling 4.5°. As such, it is likely that neurons with their classical receptive fields tuned to the centre of this stimulus are affected to some extent by the target stimulus contrast presented in their extra-classical surround [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref063">63</xref>]. Gain modulations of these neurons will occur in both the AM and Flicker condition and can therefore not explain AM-induced suppression. Such response gain changes will only lower overall observer performance, which can be captured by a reduction of our model’s efficiency parameter.</p>
        <p>A second possible extra-classical receptive field effect may stem from the fact that, in the Flicker condition, the target grating is presented together with two inducers, while in the AM condition, the target grating is surrounded by maximally one inducer at any given time. One could argue that the inducers cause surround suppression or facilitation in the neurons responsible for detecting the target grating. This would mean that AM-induced effects are an instance of the traditional extra-classical receptive field effects as discussed in, e.g., Henry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref059">59</xref>]. However, in that case, we would expect these effects to be larger in the Flicker condition than in the AM condition as the former condition involves more simultaneous surround stimulation. In other words, we would expect facilitation or suppression in the Flicker condition. Rather, we clearly observed that performance is affected in the AM condition instead. Indeed, maximal performance is strongly limited in the AM condition. Such a performance limit is not observed in a typical “baseline” contrast detection task in the absence of inducers. The psychometric functions found in the Flicker condition, on the other hand, do resemble the functions found for standard baseline contrast detection. This suggests that it is the specific spatio-temporal pattern of inducer presentation in the AM condition that causes both the percept of AM as well as response suppression. This suppression can in itself be seen as a dynamic extra-classical receptive field effect, but one that is different from the more traditional extra-classical receptive field effects.</p>

        <title>AM-induced masking cannot be explained by attention</title>
        <p>When considering the effect of <italic>spatial</italic> attention, one possibility is that the target grating location is attended less in the AM condition compared to the Flicker condition. The inducers in the Flicker condition may both attract attention, resulting in a locus of attention on a spatial region which includes the target grating. In the AM condition, on the other hand, each inducer appears separately. This may cause observers to alternately focus on the two inducer locations, thereby neglecting the location of the target grating. Recall that our model revealed that AM-induced masking is mainly due to suppression of neurons tuned to the target location. To judge whether spatial attention to one of the inducers can lead to such suppression, one has to consider the scale at which spatial attention operates. Various neurophysiological studies have found that spatial attention to a specific location can indeed lead to response suppression of neurons in early visual areas. However, suppression is limited to neurons tuned to locations in the immediate vicinity of the attended location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref065">65</xref>]. Psychophysical studies support this finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref067">67</xref>]. In our experiment, the target is presented at a distance of 4° from the inducers. At such a distance from the locus of attention, suppression is not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref067">67</xref>]. Consequently, we do not consider spatial attention as a plausible explanation of AM-induced effects.</p>
        <p>Likewise, <italic>feature-based</italic> attention cannot account for our results. This form of attention has been found to enhance the processing of attended visual features at the expense of features that are not attended. In our task, the relevant visual feature is arguably grating orientation. However, we found the detectability of the target grating to be <italic>impaired</italic> when its orientation was close to the horizontal inducer orientation. This finding cannot be attributed to feature-based attention improving the detectability of more vertical orientations at the expense of horizontal orientations. If that would indeed be the case, one would expect improved detectability at vertical orientations, which was not observed in our study.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In the present study, we made three important contributions to the understanding of AM. First, we discovered a central but hitherto unnoticed aspect of AM masking, namely the upper bound on detection performance. Second, we identified orientation-tuned suppression of responses in early visual cortex as the major cause of AM masking. This suppression may be explained by predictive coding models of cortical processing, proposing that higher-level predictions of motion are generated which “explain away” lower-level responses to expected sensory input. Third, we concluded that perceptual filling-in of the motion path does not occur at an early stage of visual processing. Further research is needed to determine exactly where and how AM is implemented in the brain and whether predictive coding theory can fully account for AM-induced response suppression.</p>

        <p>Five observers (AV, BO, CV, EV, and SG) participated in the experiment. All were naive to the purpose of the study and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (age range 20–23). The study was approved by the Social and Societal Ethics Committee of the University of Leuven. Written consent was obtained for all participants before the start of the experiment. Observers were paid 8 euros an hour for participating. A block of 50 practice trials were conducted to familiarize subjects with the stimuli and task.

        <p>Stimuli were generated and presented using a ViSaGe stimulus generator (Cambridge Research Systems, Cambridge, England) controlled by MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, US). A linearized ViewSonic G90fB monitor (ViewSonic, California, USA) was used to display the stimuli. The monitor had a spatial resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels and operated at a refresh rate of 118 Hz, with 8-bit luminance precision for all contrast levels used in the study. Participants were seated in a darkened room with their heads supported by a chin rest, at a viewing distance of 60 cm (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.0315° of visual angle). The mean background luminance of the screen was equal to 72.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Participants’ responses were registered by means of a Cedrus response box (RB-530, Cambridge Research Systems).</p>

        <title>Eye movement recording</title>
        <p>A video-based infrared eye tracker was used (EyeLink 1000, desktop version, SR Research Ltd., Ontario, Canada) in a control experiment to ensure that observers’ eye positions remained fixated on the fixation cross in the centre of the screen during the course of a trial (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005155.s002">S2 Text</xref>).

A calibration procedure was performed at the start of the experiment and was repeated at regular times during the experiment. During the calibration procedure, participants were asked to follow a dot presented at each of nine locations on the screen. This procedure was repeated until the positions of the recorded fixations were aligned on a three by three rectangular grid. At the beginning of each trial, observers were instructed to fixate a cross in the centre of the screen. This cross was presented until the experimenter pressed the space bar, which triggered correction for drifts in recorded eye positions due to small head movements. If deviation between eye position and the central cross was larger than 2°, the eye tracker was recalibrated. Eye movement recording was manually interrupted by the experiment as soon as the observers made a response.</p>

The target grating was presented at 10° eccentricity either left or right from a fixation cross (0.76° x 0.76°). Two pairs of inducers were used, eliciting either an AM or Flicker percept both at the right and left side of the screen.

        <title>Detection task</title>
        <p>Observers were instructed to detect a target stimulus appearing either at the left or right of a fixation cross in a spatial two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. At the beginning of the trial, a fixation cross was shown for 500 ms. This fixation cross remained on the screen for the entire trial duration and observers were asked to maintain fixation on it. The inducers were then presented for a duration of 80 ms alternately at the top and bottom position at both sides of the screen with an inter-stimulus interval of 106 ms. This AM sequence was repeated four times to induce a strong percept of stimuli moving back and forth. The target was flashed briefly for 30.8 ms during the fourth AM sequence, 38 ms after the presentation of the inducer at the top position and at an intermediate position in the interstimulus interval. At the end of the trial, observers were asked to indicate at which side of the screen the target appeared. No limits were placed on the allowed reaction time. Auditory feedback was provided after each trial. In the Flicker condition, the procedure was identical, except that the inducers simultaneously appeared at the top and bottom. This disrupted the percept of motion completely, while controlling for masking effects resulting from the presence of the inducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref068">68</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005155.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows an example of part of the stimulus sequence in the AM condition in which the orientation of the target and inducers are the same.</p>

        Implementing the effect of response covariance requires elaborate Monte-Carlo simulations. To keep computations tractable, a diagonal covariance matrix is used, thereby assuming that correlations between neural responses are zero. However, V1 neurons are known to be correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref077">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref080">80</xref>]. Note that these correlations only scale down the average signal-to-noise ratio of the population response. A lower overall signal-to-noise ratio results in lower average detection performance across all conditions. To capture such variations in overall detection performance, we included a global efficiency parameter in the model’s decoding stage (cf. infra).</p>

We assume that AM can affect the encoding of gratings by changing the contrast response function in three major ways. (1) AM can introduce a level of excitation, controlled by <italic>α</italic>, (2) AM can cause inhibition, i.e., a shift of the contrast response function towards higher contrasts, controlled by <italic>β</italic>, and (3) AM can cause suppression, i.e., a reduction of the maximal contrast response, controlled by <italic>γ</italic>. In the absence of AM (as in the Flicker condition), <italic>α</italic>, <italic>β</italic> and <italic>γ</italic> are zero and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005155.e012">Eq 10</xref> reduces to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005155.e009">Eq 7</xref>. We now discuss these effects in detail.</p>
        <p>Via <italic>α</italic>, AM induces a neural response provided that the tuning function <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> evaluated at the inducer grating orientation is not zero. AM thus only excites neurons that are sensitive to the inducer orientation. In this way, we obtain responses “as if” the inducer was physically moving along the AM path. These responses thus reflect the “filling-in” of activation. In the special case that <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>tgt</italic></sub> = <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>ind</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub>, AM will induce a response that is equal to the excitatory receptive field response that would be evoked by an inducer grating with contrast <italic>α</italic> presented at the target location (for instance, during a physical motion along the AM path). As the inducer gratings were presented at 100% contrast during our experiments, complete filling-in occurs when <italic>α</italic> equals 1. It should be noted that the tuning bandwidth parameter <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> for the AM-induced excitation was allowed to differ from the bandwidth parameter <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic></sub> of the linear receptive field when fitting the model. However, the estimates of these parameters did not differ for the best-fitting model (cf. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> section).</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the responses of a given neuron <italic>i</italic> are normalized by the responses of other neurons in a gain control pool. By evoking responses in these gain control neurons, AM may cause divisive normalization. <italic>β</italic> controls the strength of this inhibitory effect. The term <italic>β</italic> * <italic>j</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>ind</italic></sub>) lowers contrast sensitivity by shifting the contrast response function to higher contrasts, but only of neurons tuned to the inducer orientation. It can be seen as an indirect effect, resulting from a more direct excitatory effect that activates the normalization mechanism. The tuning bandwidth parameter of the inhibitory effect <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>inh</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> was allowed to be different from the bandwidth parameter <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>inh</italic></sub> of the gain control pool during fitting but again, these parameters were estimated to be equal for the best-fitting model (cf. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> section).</p>
        <p>The third AM-induced effect is suppression through a reduction of response gain. <italic>γ</italic> rescales the contrast response function to lower response rates, thereby reducing the neurons’ maximal response. Similar to the other two AM effects, this suppressive effect only occurs in neurons that are tuned to the inducer orientation. The bandwidth of the tuning function is equal to the bandwidth <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>exc</italic>,<italic>AM</italic></sub> of the excitatory effect.</p>

        <p>In the decoding stage, neural responses are combined into decisions in our spatial 2AFC detection task.

        where <italic>ϵ</italic> is an efficiency parameter. This parameter can accommodate the effect of interneural correlation as mentioned previously, but can also capture other factors that may affect overall performance such as global attention level and fatigue. The purpose of our study is not to distinguish between these factors, as they only affect absolute performance and do not cause relative differences in performance between AM and Flicker conditions.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that our decoder does not use a-priori knowledge of the target grating orientation when summing filter responses. A more optimal decoder may preferentially weight filters that are tuned to the grating while ignoring filters tuned to other, irrelevant orientations. Such a decoder is not plausible in our experiments, however, as multiple target orientations were randomized across trials. Observers did not know the target orientation at the start of each trial. It would be impossible for them to implement a detection strategy tailored to grating orientation without first detecting the grating. In addition, the same decoding strategy is used in the AM and Flicker conditions. In other words, the decoder does not account for the effects of AM on filter responses. The fact that we observe strong masking indeed suggests that the decoder does not manage to discount or compensate for the AM-induced effects on the population response.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that observers are to some extent uncertain about the exact spatial location of the target in grating detection tasks, which increases the slope of the psychometric function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref035">35</xref>]. This spatial uncertainty effect could be captured by assuming a more complex decoder in our model, for instance, a non-linear decoder that selects the maximum of all neural responses to obtain the decision variable instead of computing a linear sum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref035">35</xref>]. Implementing such a decoder would involve elaborate Monte-Carlo simulations as the distribution of the decision statistic cannot be obtained analytically (cf. Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005155.e013">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005155.e018">13</xref>). Furthermore, the population of neurons assumed in our model would have to be expanded considerably to include subpopulations that are sensitive to irrelevant locations. As these operations would render model fitting computationally prohibitive, we did not implement non-linear decoding. This does not imply that our model cannot capture the increased slope of the psychometric function in the presence of spatial uncertainty. An increase of the response exponent <italic>p</italic> allows for such an increased slope. Consequently, the estimated value of <italic>p</italic> should not be taken to solely reflect V1 response acceleration but may also capture other factors mediating psychometric function steepness. Separating these factors is not a goal of the present study, as we show in the Results section that psychometric function steepness is unrelated to AM.</p>

        <p>Three parameters were poorly constrained by our data and were fixed to physiologically plausible values. These values can be changed without affecting the conclusions of this study. The concentration parameter of the gain control tuning function <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>inh</italic></sub> was set to 0.001, resulting in a broadly tuned gain control pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref055">55</xref>]. <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> was fixed at 100 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref081">81</xref>]. <italic>ζ</italic>, the proportionality constant controlling response variance, was fixed at 1.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref076">76</xref>]. A number of additional constraints were introduced. As physiological studies suggest rather low spontaneous discharge rates at the level of V1, <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> was constrained to be smaller than 5% of the maximal response <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>. The tuning functions controlling the orientation selectivity of the AM effects were not allowed to be narrower than the orientation tuning functions of the excitatory receptive fields. The reason for this constraint is that effects induced by AM are presumably the result of feedback from higher visual areas specialized in motion, such as hMT/V5+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref006">6</xref>]. These areas are typically characterized by a lower orientation selectivity compared to V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref029">29</xref>]. It is therefore unlikely that the AM effects are more selective to orientation than V1 cells. The response exponent <italic>p</italic> was not allowed to be smaller than 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref028">28</xref>] and the efficiency parameter <italic>ϵ</italic> was constrained between 0% and 100%.</p>
        <p>A total of 10 parameters were estimated using a maximum-likelihood fitting procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref069">69</xref>]. Multiple fits were performed using randomized starting values for each parameter. Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated to assess the goodness-of-fit of the models while taking into account the complexity of the model quantified as the number of fitted parameters. Parametric Monte-Carlo bootstrapping involving 1000 samples provided the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters and the distributions of the AIC statistics which were used in evaluating the quality of the model fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005155.ref070">70</xref>].</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>The ideal spatial scale, or granularity, at which infectious disease incidence should be monitored and forecast has been little explored. By identifying the optimal granularity for a given disease and host population, and matching surveillance and prediction efforts to this scale, response to emergent and recurrent outbreaks can be improved. Here we explore how granularity and representation of spatial structure affect influenza forecast accuracy within New York City. We develop network models at the borough and neighborhood levels, and use them in conjunction with surveillance data and a data assimilation method to forecast influenza activity. These forecasts are compared to an alternate system that predicts influenza for each borough or neighborhood in isolation. At the borough scale, influenza epidemics are highly synchronous despite substantial differences in intensity, and inclusion of network connectivity among boroughs generally improves forecast accuracy. At the neighborhood scale, we observe much greater spatial heterogeneity among influenza outbreaks including substantial differences in local outbreak timing and structure; however, inclusion of the network model structure generally degrades forecast accuracy. One notable exception is that local outbreak onset, particularly when signal is modest, is better predicted with the network model. These findings suggest that observation and forecast at sub-municipal scales within New York City provides richer, more discriminant information on influenza incidence, particularly at the neighborhood scale where greater heterogeneity exists, and that the spatial spread of influenza among localities can be forecast.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Influenza, or the flu, causes significant morbidity and mortality during both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Recently developed influenza forecast systems have the potential to aid public health planning for and mitigation of the burden of this disease. However, current forecasts are often generated at spatial scales (e.g. national level) that are coarser than the scales at which public health measures and interventions are implemented (e.g. community level). Here we build and test influenza forecast systems at county and community levels, which either include spatial connectivity among locations or are run in isolation. We test these four flu forecast systems (i.e. 2 models × 2 spatial scales) using data collected from 2008 to 2013, including the 2009 pandemic, for the five boroughs (corresponding to county level) and 42 neighborhoods (corresponding to community level) in New York City. We compare the performance of the four forecast systems in predicting the onset, duration, and intensity of flu outbreaks and found that the performance varied by spatial scale (borough vs. neighborhood), season (non-pandemic vs. pandemic) and metric (onset, duration, and intensity). In general, the inclusion of spatial network connectivity in the forecast model improves forecast accuracy at the borough scale but degrades accuracy at the neighborhood scale.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Each year, influenza epidemics in the U.S. lead to between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths and cost an estimated $87 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref002">2</xref>]. These significant costs motivate development of forecast systems to predict the epidemic growth of this disease to aid the implementation of more proactive countermeasures. Recent efforts have developed a number of forecast systems for predicting influenza epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref009">9</xref>]. The skill of each of these systems depends on a number of factors, including: (1) the accuracy and richness of available observational data; (2) the ability of the disease model to capture disease dynamics (should a disease model be part of the forecast system); and (3) the effectiveness of the statistical method used to estimate the data and/or model epidemic features prior to forecast (either statistical characteristics of the epidemic curve or optimized model state-space). Addressing the last factor, our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref010">10</xref>] compared the performance of six statistical methods—three ensemble filters and three particle type filters—for the forecast of seasonal influenza epidemics in the US, using the same influenza epidemic model, and revealed key differences among those methods. The model employed for that study depicted influenza transmission dynamics at the municipal scale and had no spatial component. Here we examine whether the inclusion of spatial dynamics improves influenza forecast. In addition, the effect of observation scale, i.e. granularity, on forecast performance is also explored.</p>
        <p>Mechanistic models used for disease forecast systems fall into two general categories—compartmental and agent based. Compartmental disease models divide a population into different groups (e.g., susceptible, infected, and removed) according to relevant disease states and apply a set of ordinary differential equations to compute the flow of simulated people among those compartments. In contrast, agent based models simulate the activity and infection state of individuals within a synthetic population based on prescribed schemes of individual behaviors and interactions. While agent based models are more computationally expensive and their model complexity limits their generalizability, compartmental models are often criticized for oversimplifying system dynamics. In particular, compartmental models assume that the entire population (e.g. a country, state, or city) is perfectly mixed; however, even within a city there may be considerable spatial heterogeneity leading to differing disease dynamics at different sub-populations and locations.</p>
        <p>Such heterogeneities are evident in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s002">S1 Movie</xref>, which shows how influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence, as estimated by syndromic surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011">11</xref>], varies in space and time in the 42 neighborhoods of New York City (NYC). Both epidemic intensity and timing differ considerably among the neighborhoods, as disease dynamics are likely driven by both local transmission and inter-locale interaction. Indeed, past studies have shown that commuter flows contribute to the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza epidemics in the US and drive the spatial synchrony among states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012">12</xref>]. As such, the ability of a model to capture spatial connectivity could be an important factor for developing accurate predictive models, as has been demonstrated for a number of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
        <p>In this study, we investigate how the inclusion of spatial heterogeneity affects the accuracy of influenza forecast for different geospatial scales. Specifically, we address two questions: (1) at what spatial scale (i.e. granularity) of simulation does inclusion of spatial connection improve forecast performance; and (2) whether forecast performance differs between interpandemic and pandemic seasons given the differing transmissibility of influenza strains. To address these questions, we build a forecast system using a patch network epidemic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref014">14</xref>], in conjunction with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref015">15</xref>]. The patch network model incorporates spatial connectivity among subpopulations, and each subpopulation is described by a compartmental model. The EAKF data assimilation method is used to optimize the model prior to generating a forecast.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have suggested that the product of the ILI consultation rate and laboratory-confirmed influenza positive rate, termed ILI+, provides a more accurate measure of influenza activity and allows more accurate prediction of influenza epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref017">17</xref>]. Here we test our network forecast system at borough and neighborhood spatial resolutions using ILI+ data collected in NYC from January 2008 to September 2013, including the 2009 pandemic. For each spatial scale, we report the performance of this network model forecast system in comparison to forecasts run in isolation for each locality (referred to as the “isolation” model hereafter).</p>

        <title>Data</title>
        <p>Influenza-like illness (ILI) data were collected by the emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011">11</xref>]. This dataset includes weekly ILI syndrome ED visit counts and all-cause ED visit counts at the patient zip-code level, from the week ending 1/12/2008 to the week ending 9/21/2013. ILI syndrome ED visits were defined for patient chief complaints containing a mention of fever and cough, fever and sore throat, or an influenza term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011">11</xref>], analogous to the traditional surveillance definition of ILI as patient presentation with fever ≥37.8°C, a cough or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref018">18</xref>]. In Staten Island, one of the five NYC boroughs, the majority of ILI syndrome ED visits were recorded only when a visit resulted in hospitalization; as such, ILI syndrome ED visit counts in Staten Island are biased low relative to other boroughs.</p>
        <p>As these ILI counts are sparse for each zip-code area, we aggregated the ILI data by borough as well as by United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhood, which are similar to community planning district boundaries, and each contain approximately 200,000 people. During the study period, there were 42 UHF neighborhoods in NYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref019">19</xref>]. ILI proportions were calculated as ILI syndrome ED visits divided by total ED visits. Because ILI may include diseases other than influenza, we multiplied the neighborhood or borough ILI proportions by the influenza virus isolation rates for the same week to obtain a more specific measure for influenza (termed ILI+) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref017">17</xref>]. Influenza virus isolation rates were provided by the World Health Organization and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (WHO-NREVSS) for Health and Human Service (HHS) Region 2, which includes NYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>The ILI+ time series here include three full inter-pandemic seasons (i.e. from Week 40 to Week 20 of the next year for seasons 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2012–13), two half seasons (data for the 2007–08 season beginning Week 2 of 2008 and for the 2008–09 season truncated at Week 16 of 2009 due to the pandemic), and two pandemic waves (Weeks 14–33 in 2009 for the spring wave and Week 31 in 2009 through Week 20 in 2010 for the fall wave). Note the main epidemic course was captured for both of the two half seasons.</p>

        <title>SIRS-network model</title>
        <p>In our previous studies, we used a humidity forced susceptible-infected-removed-susceptible (SIRS) model to simulate the transmission of influenza in US cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref021">21</xref>]. Here we used the same model for simulations in individual boroughs or neighborhoods. The network model includes transmission of influenza within individual locales (either boroughs or neighborhoods) per the humidity forced SIRS model and inter-locale transmission per a gravity type model. Specifically, the network-SIRS model is described by the following equations:

The same <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) values were used for all locales of NYC, as the spatial variability of daily humidity is not great across the city, particularly relative to synoptic and seasonal fluctuations. Further, as daily specific humidity is not available for real-time forecast, we instead used daily climatological specific humidity averaged over 1979–2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref025">25</xref>], which captures the average seasonal cycle, both during model optimization and forecast.</p>

After the update, the ensemble is integrated to the end of Week 2 and then is updated again using the Week 2 observation of ILI+. This prediction-update filtering process is repeated up to the last observation prior to the generation of forecast. In so doing, the EAKF recursively optimizes the model system to obtain more truthful estimates of model states and parameters. Following any weekly update, a forecast can be generated by integrating the optimized ensemble of model simulations, i.e. the posterior, to the end of the influenza season.</p>

        <p>The system was run discontinuously for each flu season, i.e., the system was initialized at the beginning of each season and “trained” using observations for the current season up to the week of forecast. For all interpandemic seasons but 2007–08, this initialization occurred at Week 40; the incomplete 2007–08 season was initialized at Week 2; the pandemic waves were initialized when influenza transmission occurred out-of-season. Once the first 4 weeks of observations had been assimilated, forecasts were generated weekly until the end of the season (i.e. Week 20 of the next year for interpandemic seasons or four weeks prior to the last observation for the 2008–09 season and the spring pandemic wave). To account for stochasticity in model initialization, 20 separate ensemble simulations were initialized and used to generate weekly forecasts for each season.</p>

        <title>Baseline forecast</title>
        <p>For comparison, we developed an additional set of forecasts using an analog method as baseline. Briefly, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the ILI+ time series for the current season up to latest observation and the same period of each historical season were computed. These correlation coefficients represent the similarity in epidemic timing and intensity between the current season and historical seasons. A prediction of ILI+ for the remainder of the season was then computed as the weighted average of the historical time series that correlated positively with the current season (weights are proportional to the correlation coefficients and summed to 1). For real-time forecast, only available historical record can be used; however, as our study period included only seven outbreaks, here we used records for all seven outbreaks to generate the forecasts, regardless of temporal sequence. Due to the small number of locales at the borough scale (i.e. 5) and outbreaks (i.e. 7), we performed this comparison only at the UHF neighborhood scale (i.e. 42 in total). We developed the weighted average in two ways—one using historical records for the same neighborhood (corresponding to the “isolation” model for the EAKF forecasts) and one using records from all neighborhoods (corresponding to the network model for the EAKF forecasts).</p>

        <title>Forecast evaluation</title>
        <p>In our previous studies, we evaluated the accuracy of predictions of epidemic peak timing (i.e. the week with highest ILI+) and peak intensity. In this study, because observations at finer spatial scale may include relatively larger observational errors and thus render the specific week and level of peak incidence less meaningful (e.g. multiple weeks may have similar ILI+ magnitudes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we here instead evaluated the accuracy predicting the timing and number of weeks at or above various levels of ILI+ (i.e. 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3%). These ILI+ levels represent different stages of influenza activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>). ILI+ at 0.1–0.25% is close to incidence levels during the onset of an outbreak, 0.5–1% represents incidence at mid-season, 1–2% represents peak levels during inter-pandemic seasons and the Fall 2009 pandemic wave, and higher levels (e.g. 3%) mostly only occurred during the Spring 2009 pandemic wave.</p>

        <p>For each level, we evaluated system accuracy predicting the onset (i.e. the first week ILI+ reaches the target level), the duration (i.e. the number of weeks above the target level), and cumulative ILI+ over the duration. To account for observational noise in the data, we computed the 3-week centered moving average for each ILI+ time series and used those moving averages to evaluate the forecasts (referred to as reference hereafter), rather than use the raw ILI+ observations. For onset, a forecast within ±1 week of the reference onset was deemed accurate; for duration, a forecast with a predicted onset within ±1 week of the reference onset and a predicted duration within ±2 weeks of the reference duration was deemed accurate; for cumulative ILI+, a forecast with a predicted onset within ±1 week of the reference onset and a predicted ILI+ sum over the predicted duration within ±20% of the reference value was deemed accurate. Note that the evaluation of duration and cumulative ILI+ takes into account the predicted epidemic timing, in addition to the time span or magnitude; for instance, a forecast with a predicted onset at Week 1 and a predicted duration of 10 weeks will be deemed inaccurate if the observed epidemic started from Week 3 and lasted 10 weeks.</p>
        <p>These new forecast metrics will provide users (e.g. public health officials) additional information on the progression of an epidemic that we believe may be more relevant for planning at the local scale. For each metric, we focus our evaluation at shorter leads from 5 weeks (i.e. the event is predicted to occur 5 weeks ahead of the forecast week) to -5 weeks (i.e. the event is predicted to have passed 5 weeks prior to the forecast week). Note forecast accuracy at negative leads is important as well, as it indicates the forecast system is not generating false predictions.</p>

        <title>The performance of forecasts varies by metrics</title>
        <p>As epidemic intensity varies substantially by season and spatial scale, the same ILI+ level can correspond to different phases of an epidemic. For instance, in the borough of Manhattan, 0.5% ILI+ is roughly the peak of the 2008–09 season but the start of the spring pandemic wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, generally, 0.25% ILI+ corresponds to influenza activity at the start of the season, 0.5–1% ILI+ corresponds to elevated influenza activity, and 2% and above ILI+ corresponds to peak levels. Therefore, in general accurate prediction of onset, duration, and cumulative ILI+ at the 0.25% level corresponds to accurate prediction of outbreak onset, duration for the flu season, and cumulative ILI+ over the entire season (1<sup>st</sup> row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g003">Fig 3</xref>); similarly, the accuracies predicting the three metrics at the 0.5% and 1% ILI+ levels (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and 2% ILI+ level (4<sup>th</sup> row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g003">Fig 3</xref>) reflect the performance of forecast system predicting increased flu activity and peak activity.</p>

Each row shows the forecast accuracy for different epidemic intensity levels (i.e. 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% ILI+) at different leads (x-axis); each column shows the accuracy predicting onset, duration, and cumulative incidence. For onset predictions, the leads are relative to the predicted onset, e.g., 5 weeks in the future (lead = 5), or 5 weeks in the past (lead = −5); for duration or cumulative incidence predictions, the leads are relative to the midpoint of predicted onset and ending. For onset, a predicted value within ±1 week of observed onset was deemed accurate; for duration, a prediction with an onset within ±1 week of observed onset and a duration within ±2 week of observed duration was deemed accurate; for cumulative incidence, a prediction with an onset within ±1 week of observed onset and cumulative incidence over the predicted duration within ±20% of observed cumulative incidence was deemed accurate.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows forecast accuracy for the four forecast systems using the EAKF (network vs. individual locale and borough vs. neighborhood) over the 2007–08 through 2012–13 seasons for four ILI+ levels. All four forecast systems were able to accurately predict onset for different ILI+ levels, and largely outperformed the baseline analog forecast method. Tallied over all weekly ensemble forecasts, forecast accuracies were 81.9% (0.25% ILI+), 73.8% (0.5% ILI+), 55.3% (1% ILI+), and 28.5% (2% ILI+) 1 week prior to the <italic>predicted</italic> onset (i.e. 1 week lead), increased to 97.3%, 91.9%, 86.0%, and 84.9%, respectively, for the four ILI+ levels at 0 lead, and stayed at similar high accuracies at negative leads (i.e. when the onset is predicted to be in the past).</p>
        <p>In comparison, forecast accuracy for duration at each level was lower, specifically, with 43.8% (0.25% ILI+), 49.3% (0.5% ILI+), 71.2% (1% ILI+), and 77.1% (2% ILI+) of forecasts accurate at the week the epidemic was predicted to have reached the midpoint of the time-interval ILI+ was above the target level (i.e. 0 lead). Such lower accuracies are not surprising as prediction of duration depends on the ability to predict both the onset and the end point above a given ILI+ level; prediction of the end point is challenging, in particular for low ILI+ levels (e.g., 0.25%) for which the duration could last over 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). For the two higher ILI+ levels (i.e. 1% and 2%), for which the outbreak duration tended to be shorter, accuracies were much higher. However, forecast accuracy at all levels improved over time and reached 64.9%, 77.8%, 82.7%, and 84.9% for the four ILI+ levels 5 weeks after the predicted midpoint for the corresponding ILI+ level, which for many localities and seasons was still in advance of the end of the outbreak.</p>
        <p>Similarly, forecast accuracy for cumulative ILI+ was lower than for onset. Forecasts of cumulative ILI+ for the duration above a given level had accuracies of 54.18% (0.25% ILI+), 44.8% (0.5% ILI+), 41.3% (1% ILI+), and 40.8% (2% ILI+) at the week the epidemic was predicted to have reached the midpoint of time above target ILI+ level (i.e. 0 lead). These accuracies increased steadily over time and reached 80.1%, 76.2%, 63.0%, 63.9%, respectively, for the four ILI+ levels 5 weeks after the predicted midpoint.</p>

        <p>The differences in forecast accuracy at borough scale over different leads are further demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Tallied over all seasons, prospective forecasts (i.e. positive leads) for onset and duration at lower ILI+ levels (0.1–1%) generated by the borough network model forecast system were more accurate than those generated by the isolation model forecast system (the red regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). However, for higher ILI+ levels (1.5–3%), the isolation model forecast system outperformed the network version (blue regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). For forecasts of cumulative ILI+ at all levels evaluated, the borough network model forecast system was more accurate at -5 to 1 week leads while the isolation model forecast system was more accurate at 2 to 5 week leads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast, the inclusion of network structure at the neighborhood scale in the epidemic model significantly reduced forecast accuracy for most leads and metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005201.t001">Table 1</xref>). The main improvement facilitated by inclusion of the network connection among neighborhoods was seen for prospective prediction of onset at the 0.1–1% ILI+ levels (the red region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

        <p>We additionally examined how the inclusion of network structure in the model affects forecast accuracy during interpandemic seasons and the two pandemic waves. While the inclusion of network structure at the borough scale substantially improved forecast accuracy for duration (8.3%; confidence interval: [5.6%, 11.1%], at -5 to 5 week leads, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005201.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s004">S2 Fig</xref>) and cumulative ILI+ (13.7% [10.5%, 16.9%] at -5 to 5 week leads) during the two pandemic waves, it degraded forecast accuracy for these two metrics during interpandemic seasons (-3.6% [-5.2%, -2.0%] and -5.4% [-7.2%, -3.6%] at -5 to 5 week leads, respectively). In addition, at the borough scale, the network model consistently outperformed the isolation model when predicting onset during both the interpandemic seasons and the two pandemic waves.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Spatial connectivity has been identified as an important factor shaping the spatial dynamics and progression of infectious disease epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref031">31</xref>]. Here we examine how the inclusion of spatial structure among sub-populations within a municipality influences the performance of an influenza forecast system. We applied a patch network model in conjunction with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and weekly ILI+ observations at both the borough and neighborhood levels in NYC and forecast both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks at those two granularities.</p>
        <p>The network connection in our forecast system was formulated as a combination of the gravity model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012">12</xref>] and the radiation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref032">32</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). In essence, this network connection model computes the raw connections between sub-region pairs (e.g. between boroughs) using a gravity-type formula and further normalizes these raw quantities over the entire region (i.e. all of NYC), which resembles the radiation model. In previous work, we applied this network connection model to sub-regions delineated by population size and area, and used it to compute the spatial connection and infer the transmission network of the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref014">14</xref>]. Here, we used population density instead of population size as model input. This choice was motivated by the high variability of population density within NYC. For example, population density in Manhattan, the borough that attracts the largest number of commuters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026">26</xref>], is 2.58 times of the city average, even though its residents only make up 19.4% of the city’s population. Using this configuration, our model was able to generate commuter flows similar to those revealed in census data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026">26</xref>] for the majority of boroughs. To test further the impact of potential misrepresentation of the network connectivity, we used commuter census data for the five boroughs in NYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026">26</xref>] to configure the network connections in the forecast system (see Supplementary Material). The forecasts made using this alternative network configuration had similar accuracy to those made without the commuter census data (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.2954, Supplementary Material). This finding suggests that our network model is able to capture the impact of spatial connectivity on influenza transmission dynamics in NYC at the borough scale. In addition, the model parameters estimated using the network model were in general consistent with those reported previously for U.S. cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref021">21</xref>] (see Supplementary Material and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s005">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>The effects of spatial connectivity on disease transmission are usually two fold—it can introduce a disease into new regions during the early phase of an epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref034">34</xref>], and it can synchronize disease progression among regions over the course of an epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref035">35</xref>]. Here we examined both effects in the context of influenza forecast. We found that inclusion of spatial connectivity within a city improved the accuracy of <italic>prospective</italic> forecast of epidemic onset, particularly during interpandemic seasons. This finding underscores the importance of spatial connectivity to disease invasion during the very early phase of an epidemic. In contrast, the effect of inclusion of network structure in the forecast system was mixed in predicting the duration and cumulative ILI+, two later phase metrics. For forecast during the pandemic at the borough scale, the network structure improved prediction accuracy for cumulative ILI+. Influenza moved rapidly through the city during the pandemic, leading to more synchronized dynamics among locales; these synchronized observations probably reinforced the inference and further optimized the system prior to the generation of forecast. However, the network structure degraded the accuracy of cumulative ILI+ for interpandemic events. This finding indicates that the influence of spatial connectivity wanes over the course of a seasonal influenza epidemic and that once the epidemic is established in a locality it is fueled primarily by local transmission dynamics.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of network structure and additional data streams in general improved forecast accuracy at the borough level but lowered the accuracy at the neighborhood level. The inferior performance at the neighborhood level may be attributed to two factors: (1) the network model failed to capture the connectivity among neighborhoods, i.e. how local dynamics and heterogeneities propagate across neighborhoods; and (2) assimilation of data streams from outside neighborhoods amplified observational noise, which in turn degraded forecast accuracy. For the former, heterogeneities in epidemic progression at the neighborhood level not only come from differing rates of population mixing (for which the network structure is primarily designed), but also from other factors such as population demographics (e.g. different age-structure and school-age populations) and healthcare seeking behaviors, which affect the number of cases recorded by the surveillance system. These heterogeneities, as captured in the observed ILI records (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s002">S1 Movie</xref>), likely reflect local dynamics that, in contrast to our network model specification, do not propagate outside the neighborhood. Work to investigate the nature of these neighborhood level heterogeneities is underway.</p>
        <p>To test the impact of the latter factor, i.e. confounding from outside signals through data assimilation, we generated forecasts for the 3-wk and 5-wk centered moving averages of the neighborhood ILI+ time series. These smoothed signals are less erratic than the raw observations so that the signal from connected neighboring localities is more stable over time. Indeed, the forecast accuracies for these two smoothed time series were substantially higher than those for the raw observations, and forecasts generated using the network model-EAKF forecast system were more comparable to those run in isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005201.s006">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, these findings suggest that the heterogeneities captured in the neighborhood level dataset represent local dynamics or observational biases that do not impinge upon the signal of other neighborhoods. As a result, forecasting at the neighborhood scale is more accurate when each neighborhood is run independently in isolation. In contrast, at the borough scale, these heterogeneities are aggregated and homogenized; our network model, capturing the connectivity via commuter flow, likely reflects the primary inter-connections among boroughs and thus to some extent improved forecast accuracy. For these reasons, our findings here do not entirely dismiss inclusion of spatial heterogeneity among subpopulations in forecast models. Rather, it suggests that to improve the forecast model, the network structure should represent spatial connectivity at the appropriate scale. Indeed, the lack of forecast improvement at the neighborhood scale may simply indicate that alternate, more detailed modeling approaches are needed. Such approaches would need to be supported by richer observation at an appropriate granularity so that critical epidemiological processes, in addition to population mobility, could be represented and optimized.</p>
        <p>We recognize a number of limitations in this study. Our conclusions were drawn based on only seven outbreaks; a more robust evaluation is warranted as more observations become available. We did not include age-structure in our model, an important demographic factor shaping influenza transmission dynamics. The ED ILI counts were recorded by age group; however, age-grouped ILI ED counts were too low at the UHF neighborhood level to allow meaningfully analysis. Future work using data from other surveillance systems may resolve this issue. Another potential confounder stemmed from the ED ILI data for Staten Island, one of the five NYC boroughs, which only included hospitalized cases. To address this issue, we used a different prior distribution of scaling factor (<italic>γ</italic>) for localities within Staten Island (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005201.ref021">21</xref>] showed that this scaling factor is able to compensate for missing data; it thus may to some extent mitigate adverse impacts on the network model.</p>
        <p>Due to a lack of city-specific data, we used influenza viral isolation rates reported for HHS Region 2 to compute the ILI+ for NYC. As viral testing practice may vary by geographical location, the viral isolation rates used here may not be representative of those for NYC and may introduce systematic biases into the ILI+ data. In addition, the ILI+ data used here were based on ED ILI visits and hence may not be representative of influenza activity among the general population. Nevertheless, forecast of ED ILI+ in itself is important as it could provide health professionals at EDs advanced lead-time to plan for changes in influenza-related visits.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have developed a network model-filter forecast system for the forecast of influenza at borough and neighborhood geospatial scales. When tested using data for NYC, this network forecast system was able to improve forecast accuracy at the borough level, for which spatial connection is linked primarily via commuter flow. In contrast, it degraded forecast accuracy at the neighborhood scale. NYC is a large municipality with a sizeable geographic extent and many neighborhoods; however, even within smaller cities, community and neighborhood heterogeneity may lead to variable disease transmission dynamics. Local public health measures implemented at sub-municipal scales would therefore benefit from surveillance and forecast enacted at those more local scales. Future work should continue to explore spatial granularity and identify the optimal scales for disease surveillance, forecast and intervention. In so doing, the network model forecast system should be extended to other cities and geographic units (e.g. states) to examine its utility in these different settings and spatial scales.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>HIV-1 entry can be inhibited by soluble peptides from the gp41 heptad repeat-2 (HR2) domain that interfere with formation of the 6-helix bundle during fusion. Inhibition has also been seen when these peptides are conjugated to anchoring molecules and over-expressed on the cell surface. We hypothesized that potent anti-HIV activity could be achieved if a 34 amino acid peptide from HR2 (C34) were brought to the site of virus-cell interactions by conjugation to the amino termini of HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4. C34-conjugated coreceptors were expressed on the surface of T cell lines and primary CD4 T cells, retained the ability to mediate chemotaxis in response to cognate chemokines, and were highly resistant to HIV-1 utilization for entry. Notably, C34-conjugated CCR5 and CXCR4 each exhibited potent and broad inhibition of HIV-1 isolates from diverse clades irrespective of tropism (i.e., each could inhibit R5, X4 and dual-tropic isolates). This inhibition was highly specific and dependent on positioning of the peptide, as HIV-1 infection was poorly inhibited when C34 was conjugated to the amino terminus of CD4. C34-conjugated coreceptors could also inhibit HIV-1 isolates that were resistant to the soluble HR2 peptide inhibitor, enfuvirtide. When introduced into primary cells, CD4 T cells expressing C34-conjugated coreceptors exhibited physiologic responses to T cell activation while inhibiting diverse HIV-1 isolates, and cells containing C34-conjugated CXCR4 expanded during HIV-1 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a humanized mouse model. Notably, the C34-conjugated peptide exerted greater HIV-1 inhibition when conjugated to CXCR4 than to CCR5. Thus, antiviral effects of HR2 peptides can be specifically directed to the site of viral entry where they provide potent and broad inhibition of HIV-1. This approach to engineer HIV-1 resistance in functional CD4 T cells may provide a novel cell-based therapeutic for controlling HIV infection in humans.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>HIV-1 infection persists and requires life-long therapy. Approaches to prevent viral replication in the absence of treatment will likely require effective antiviral immune responses, but this goal has been confounded by HIV-1’s ability to target CD4 T cells that coordinate adaptive immunity. We describe a novel approach to confer HIV-resistance to CD4 T cells using peptides from the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat-2 (HR2) domain to inhibit infection. By linking a 34 amino acid HR2 peptide to the amino terminus of CCR5 or CXCR4 we were able to use the physiologic trafficking of these coreceptors to deliver the inhibitory peptide to sites of viral fusion where they exerted potent, specific and broad resistance irrespective of viral clade or tropism. This effect was highly dependent on the positioning of the peptide and most effective when conjugated to CXCR4. <italic>In vitro</italic> and in humanized mice, primary CD4 T cells were protected and expanded following HIV-1 infection. This work represents a proof of concept that T cells can be genetically engineered to resist infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and provides a rationale to explore this approach as a novel cell-based therapeutic in strategies to augment antiviral immune responses that target viral reservoirs and for long-term control of HIV-1.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>HIV-1 infection persists in the face of suppressive anti-retroviral therapy, and following cessation of treatment, typically rebounds rapidly, generating new rounds of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref004">4</xref>]. Viral persistence results from long-lived reservoirs that include memory CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref007">7</xref>] and perhaps other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref008">8</xref>] that are established early after infection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref009">9</xref>] and, in pathogenic models of SIV infection in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref010">10</xref>]. While there is a single example of an individual cured of HIV infection following a stem cell transplant from a donor lacking CCR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref011">11</xref>], <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref013">13</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref014">14</xref>] have strongly suggested that host immune responses will be required to eliminate or control virus in these sites. However, confounding immunologic approaches to control HIV-1 is the tropism of this virus, which targets CD4 T cells that are required to generate cellular and humoral anti-viral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
        <p>To protect and/or enhance host immune responses to HIV-1, many approaches have been developed based on engineering primary CD4 T cells to become resistant to HIV-1 infection. Findings from our group and others, have shown that gene therapy for HIV-1 is feasible and capable of generating modified CD4 and CD8 T cells that persist in HIV-infected subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref020">20</xref>], traffic to mucosal compartments where HIV-1 infection is frequently initiated and sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref021">21</xref>], and are capable of exerting selection pressure on the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref022">22</xref>]. Tebas and coworkers have recently shown that autologous peripheral CD4 T cells, rendered CCR5-negative through zinc-finger nuclease treatment and expanded <italic>ex vivo</italic>, could be re-infused safely into HIV-infected subjects where they persisted for months to years and expanded in the context of an interruption in anti-retroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref021">21</xref>]. In this study there was a striking correlation in frequency of disrupted CCR5 alleles and HIV-1 control after ART was removed, indicating that approaches to increase the number of protected CD4 T cells may lead to more durable control. However, while editing peripheral CD4 T cells to be CCR5-negative is feasible and can confer resistance to R5-tropic viruses, there are logistical concerns in that for maximal effect both alleles must be targeted and because this approach would be ineffective for X4- or dual-tropic HIV-1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref023">23</xref>]. Although complementary methods to ablate both CCR5 and CXCR4 are feasible, this dual mutagenesis occurs with relatively lower efficiency and carries the risk of causing possible functional defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
        <p>Many strategies to confer resistance to primary CD4 T cells involve stable expression of a transgene to produce an inhibitory protein or nucleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref025">25</xref>]. Building on the theme that soluble peptides from the HIV-1 envelope heptad repeat-2 domain (HR2) can inhibit viral entry by blocking formation of the gp41 6-helix bundle that is required for membrane fusion, inhibitory proteins containing the C-terminal 46 (C46) or 36 (C36) amino acids from HR2 conjugated to a membrane-associated scaffold protein have been shown to broadly inhibit R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref029">29</xref>]. These membrane anchored constructs exhibited antiviral effects when introduced into primary CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref031">31</xref>] and were well tolerated and non-immunogenic in a human trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref032">32</xref>]. However, their antiviral activity is dependent on high levels of expression on the cell surface, which can vary considerably in different cell types, and is further influenced by the design of the anchoring protein and <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements in the vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref034">34</xref>]. Work in this area has gone forward in nonhuman primate simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) models using hematopoetic stem cells transduced with a C46-containing protein where a survival advantage of transduced cells was shown along with a reduction in plasma viremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref035">35</xref>]. However, no therapeutic benefit or clear antiviral effect was observed in a human trial when peripheral CD4 T cells were transduced <italic>ex vivo</italic> with a similar vector and re-infused into patients, most likely due to insufficient levels of gene-protected T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
        <p>Considering these findings, we reasoned that the potency and effectiveness of cell-based HR2-peptide inhibition could be increased if this peptide were brought to the precise site of viral entry by conjugation to molecules directly involved with HIV-1 entry, rather than to artificial scaffold proteins expressed nonspecifically on the cell surface. We introduced a 34 amino acid peptide from HR2 (C34) onto the amino termini of either CD4 or coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4. Strikingly, C34-conjugated coreceptors exhibited potent HIV-1 inhibition, with the greatest effect observed for C34-conjugated CXCR4. Considerably less inhibition was observed when C34 was fused to CD4. C34-coreceptor inhibition was dependent on peptide sequence, occurred irrespective of viral tropism for CCR5 or CXCR4 and on multiple viral clades, and occurred for HIV-1 isolates that were resistant to the soluble HR2 peptide inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Primary CD4 T cells expressing C34-conjugated coreceptors, particularly C34-CXCR4, were resistant to HIV-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in NOD/SCID IL-2Rγnull (NSG) mice, as seen by expansion of these cells during HIV-1 infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that stable expression of C34-containing coreceptors on peripheral CD4 T cells can confer potent and broad resistance to HIV-1 and may provide a novel strategy to augment anti-viral immune responses that complement approaches to target or control HIV-1 reservoirs in infected individuals.</p>

        <p>A 34 amino acid peptide from the gp41 HR2 domain, corresponding to amino acids 628–661 in HxB2, was fused directly to the amino terminus of either CCR5 or CXCR4 flanked by an N-terminal alanine and C-terminal leucine, lysine linkers <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s003">S1 Fig</xref>)</bold>. When these C34-CCR5 or C34-CXCR4 coreceptors were transiently expressed with human CD4 on Cf2-Luc reporter cells and viral entry assessed using R5-tropic BaL or X4-tropic HxB2 HIV-1, respectively, only background levels of entry were detectable relative to unconjugated coreceptors (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). When stably introduced via a lentiviral vector into human CD4<sup>+</sup> SupT1 cells, from which endogenous CXCR4 had been ablated, (a line termed, A66 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref036">36</xref>]) C34-CCR5 and C34-CXCR4 were expressed on the cell surface, as detected by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the C34 peptide and with mAbs reactive with the CCR5 or CXCR4 extracellular loops (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref></bold>). A66 cells bearing C34-conjugagted CCR5 or CXCR4 migrated in a chemotaxis assay in response to CCL4 and CXCL12, respectively, indicating that coreceptors containing this amino terminal peptide continued to exhibit physiologic responses to their cognate chemokines (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s004">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Consistent with the results of viral entry assays on Cf2-Luc cells, both C34-CCR5 and C34-CXCR4 were highly resistant to BaL and HxB2 infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>) indicating that the amino terminal HR2 peptide was likely able to access and inhibit HR1 domains of the pre-hairpin intermediate to block 6 helix-bundle formation and viral entry. Similar results were seen with additional R5- (YU2, JRFL) and dual-tropic (R3A) HIV-1 isolates (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s005">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>The ability of C34-conjugated coreceptors to interact with HR1 domains was also assessed quantitatively using 5-Helix, a partial mimetic of the gp41 6-helix bundle. 5-Helix is composed of three gp41 HR1 segments and two gp41 HR2 segments, and contains a single HR2 binding site of high specificity and affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>]. Using an interaction assay employing a rhodamine-conjugated 5-Helix construct, A66 cells stably expressing C34-CCR5 or C34-CXCR4 were shown to have approximately 52,000 and 55,000 molecules per cell, respectively, with K<sub>D</sub> values less than 15 pM. Negligible binding was seen on A66 cells expressing unconjugated receptors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s006">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Collectively, these findings indicate that C34-conjugated coreceptors could be processed and presented on the cell surface, retained the ability to interact with high affinity to HR1 domains that contribute to 6-helix bundle formation during fusion, and when positioned on the coreceptor amino terminus were able to prevent HIV-1 entry and infection.</p>

        <p>We next determined if C34-conjugated coreceptors could inhibit HIV-1 when co-expressed with unconjugated coreceptors, and if so, whether inhibition would occur in a homologous (i.e., C34-CXCR4 inhibiting X4-tropic HIV-1 from using unconjugated CXCR4; C34-CCR5 inhibiting R5-tropic HIV-1 from using unconjugated CCR5) or a heterologous manner (i.e., C34-CCR5 inhibiting X4-tropic HIV-1; C34-CXCR4 inhibiting R5-tropic HIV-1). Using the Cf2-Luc transfection assay, we assessed HIV-1 entry when increasing amounts of C34-conjugated coreceptors were cotransfected with a fixed amount of unconjugated coreceptors. Cf2-Luc cells were transfected with CD4 and unconjugated CCR5 or CXCR4 alone or in combination with varying ratios of C34-conjugated CCR5 or CXCR4, inoculated with R5-tropic (BaL) or X4-tropic (HxB2) HIV-1s, and RLUs quantified as an indicator of entry. As shown (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>, <bold>Top Panels</bold>), homologous inhibition by C34-coreceptors was evident for both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1. Relative to fusion with unconjugated CCR5 or CXCR4, for both BaL and HxB2, respectively, levels of entry were comparable to cells transfected with only a GFP control, and inhibition was seen up to a 1:10 ratio of plasmids encoding C34-conjugated to unconjugated coreceptors. At a ratio of 1:10, subtracting background, BaL inhibition by C34-CCR5 was approximately 85% and HxB2 inhibition by C34-CXCR4 was &gt;95%. Similarly, heterologous inhibition was also seen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>, <bold>Bottom Panels</bold>). At input ratios up to 1:10 of C34-conjugated to unconjugated coreceptors, C34-CXCR4 could inhibit BaL from using CCR5 (85%); while C34-CCR5 could inhibit HxB2 from using CXCR4 (&gt;95%). Both homologous and heterologous inhibition were progressively lost at higher dilutions of C34-conjugated receptors.</p>

        <p>To evaluate homologous and heterologous inhibition of a spreading HIV-1 infection by C34-conjugated coreceptors, A66 cells were stably transduced to express CCR5 or CXCR4 alone or with C34-CXCR4 or C34-CCR5. C34-conjugagted coreceptors were clearly detectable, as determined by staining with an anti-C34 antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s007">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). As expected, BaL could infect A66 cells expressing CCR5 but not CXCR4; HxB2 could infect A66 cells expressing CXCR4 but not CCR5.

        <p>The specificity of C34-conjugated coreceptor inhibition of HIV-1 entry and infection was assessed by creating C34-CXCR4 constructs in which the sequence of the C34 peptide was altered at 4 (C34-S4) or 8 (C34-S8) positions shown previously to be critical for inhibiting 6-helix bundle formation and fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref043">43</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, Top Panel</bold>). These constructs were then transfected into Cf2-Luc cells with CD4 and evaluated for the ability to support infection by X4- (HxB2) or dual-tropic (R3A) HIV-1s. While C34-CXCR4 inhibited fusion for both viruses, fusion for CXCR4 conjugated to C34-S4 occurred at approximately 50% of unconjugated CXCR4, while CXCR4 conjugated to C34-S8 supported fusion at near wildtype levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, Bottom Panel</bold>). Thus, residues within the C34 peptide required for blocking 6-helix bundle formation are also required for the inhibitory effect of the C34 peptide when conjugated to CXCR4. These results clearly indicate that C34-coreceptor inhibition is highly specific.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the role of C34 peptide positioning in HIV-1 inhibition, we next determined whether this peptide would block HIV-1 entry when conjugated to the amino terminus of CD4. C34, followed by a Glu-Phe C-terminal linker, was inserted between amino acids 5 and 6 of the mature CD4 amino terminus (i.e., including the signal peptide and after the CD4 sequence, KKVVL), and this construct (designated C34-CD4) or wildtype CD4 were transiently expressed with CXCR4 or CCR5 in Cf2-Luc cells. Infection was assessed for R5- (BaL), X4- (HxB2), or dual-tropic (R3A) HIV-1s. C34-CD4 expression was verified with an anti-CD4 mAb reactive with the CD4 D1 domain and with an anti-C34 mAb (not shown). Relative to wildtype CD4, C34-conjugated CD4 when co-expressed with CXCR4 permitted fusion of HxB2 and R3A, and when co-expressed with CCR5, permitted fusion of BaL and R3A <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g003">Fig 3B</xref>)</bold>. In each case, fusion was 70–100% of the levels observed with unconjugated CD4. Thus, the ability of the C34 peptide to inhibit fusion was highly dependent on its positioning. These findings suggest that on the CD4 amino-terminus the C34 peptide was less able to access the HR1 binding site during 6-helix bundle formation and was therefore more limited in its ability to inhibit fusion, in contrast to when positioned on the more membrane-proximal coreceptor amino-terminus.</p>

        <p>Viral resistance to the soluble HR2-derived peptide enfuvirtide has been well documented <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and typically involves mutations involving gp41 amino acids 26–45 in HR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref044">44</xref>]. To determine the extent to which mutations that confer resistance to a soluble HR2 peptide could also confer resistance to C34 peptide when conjugated to a coreceptor amino terminus, we introduced 3 mutations (I37K, V38A, and N43D) individually into the HIV-1 R3A HR1 domain. Mutations at each of these positions have been implicated in enfuvirtide resistance in patients undergoing anti-retroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref047">47</xref>]. As shown (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>), when assayed in a pseudovirus entry assay on transfected Cf2-Luc cells, each mutation conferred concentration-dependent resistance on CCR5 fusion by enfuvirtide (i.e., IC<sub>50</sub> for parental R3A was 71 nM, but was ≥1000 nM for I37K, V38A and N43D Envs). However, when entry was assayed on C34-conjugated CCR5 or C34-conjugated CXCR4, all Envs were highly susceptible to inhibition <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). As a control, no inhibition by enfuvirtide or C34-coreceptors was seen for a VSV-G Env. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that when anchored to a coreceptor amino terminus and in the context of a membrane-associated intermolecular interaction, an HR2-derived peptide exhibited enhanced potency that extended to viruses resistant to soluble HR2 peptides.</p>

        <p>To determine whether C34-coreceptor expressing primary CD4 T cells were selectively enriched during HIV-1 infection, transduced and non-transduced cells were mixed prior to infection at a ratio of 1:3 and the proportion of C34-expressing cells was assessed over time in multiple donors. As shown (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>), following JRFL infection, C34-coreceptor transduced cells increased over time and by Day 14, C34-CCR5- and C34-CXCR4-expressing cells had increased to 51.5% and 66.1%, respectively. In contrast, C34-CD4-transduced cells decreased to 5.5%, with a similar decrease seen when cells were transduced with GFP (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, Lower Panels</bold>).

Once T cell engraftment was confirmed and quantified (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>) mice were challenged with mixture of R5 (US1) and X4-tropic (CMU-02) HIV-1 isolates. After eight days viral load was measured, at which time CD4 T cell levels were comparable (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>).

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>The persistence of HIV-1 in reservoirs remains the principal obstacle to curing infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref055">55</xref>]. Although a substantial proportion of viruses archived in these compartments are defective and/or unable to replicate in CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref056">56</xref>], a genetically diverse array of replication competent viruses persists for the lifetime of the infected host and is poised to replicate upon discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref058">58</xref>]. While pharmacologic approaches are being explored to reverse HIV-1 latency and drive reservoirs to a more active state that could be vulnerable to antiviral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref060">60</xref>], there has been no proof of concept to date that these agents alone can impact the size of the reservoir or its capacity to generate new infectious viruses. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have strongly suggested that whether the goal is elimination of HIV-1 reservoirs or their long-term control in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, an immunologic response will likely be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref013">13</xref>] and will need to persist and be broad enough to recognize the genetic diversity within the reservoir. This response will also need to be resistant to the immunopathogenic effects of HIV infection on CD4 T cells that provide help to initiate and sustain adaptive immunity.</p>
        <p>In this report we show that conjugating a fusion-inhibitory peptide from the gp41 HR2 domain to the amino terminus of HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 exerts potent, broad, and specific inhibition of genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates. The conjugated C34 peptide exhibited picomolar binding affinity to soluble 5-Helix, which presents HR1 domains in a trimeric context that likely reflects a structure formed as the gp41 pre-hairpin fusion intermediate transitions to the 6-helix bundle during viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>]. C34-conjugated CCR5 and CXCR4 were unable to be used for infection by R5- and X4-tropic viruses, respectively, and exhibited potent inhibition over unconjugated receptors with inhibition at input ratios of expression plasmids as low as 1 C34-conjugated to 10 unconjugated receptors. Strikingly, this <italic>trans</italic>-dominant inhibition occurred irrespective of viral tropism and across genetically diverse clades. The potency of inhibition was further reflected by the ability of C34-conjugated CCR5 to inhibit viruses that were resistant to the soluble HR2 peptide, enfuvirtide, consistent with more effective binding of the conjugated peptide to gp41 in the setting of a highly localized intermolecular interaction. <italic>In vitro</italic> and in NOG/SCID mice, CD4 T cells stably expressing C34-conjugated coreceptors appeared to be resistant to HIV-1 infection by their selective outgrowth during HIV-1 infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a novel approach to enhance the fusion-inhibiting properties of HR2 peptides and to confer broad and durable protection from HIV-1 infection to CD4 T cells by directly targeting the peptides to the precise site of fusion and viral entry.</p>
        <p>How do C34-conjugated coreceptors inhibit HIV-1 irrespective of viral tropism and with such high stoichiometric potency? Several reports have shown that CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 reside in cholesterol-rich microdomains, termed lipid rafts, on the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref063">63</xref>]. Although some reports have indicated that in contrast to CCR5, CXCR4 may be only partially present in these domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref066">66</xref>], there is general agreement that in the context of HIV-1 gp120 and virion binding to CD4, lipid rafts can serve as sites for the recruitment, concentration and colocalization of CCR5 and CXCR4 to facilitate cooperative interactions with the envelope trimer that are required for entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref066">66</xref>]. Indeed, disrupting coreceptor localization in lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion potently inhibits infection and entry of both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref064">64</xref>]. It is likely that C34-conjugated CCR5 and CXCR4 retain their physiologic trafficking and, as a result, are able to colocalize in lipid rafts with unconjugated receptors. In addition, HIV-1 entry requires highly cooperative interactions with multiple coreceptor molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref068">68</xref>] and there is evidence for direct interactions between CCR5 and CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref064">64</xref>] in lipid rafts including their ability to form heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref070">70</xref>]. Collectively these findings suggest that HR2 peptides conjugated to CCR5 or CXCR4 are well positioned to disrupt cooperative interactions between the viral envelope and coreceptors regardless of viral tropism. Lastly, it has been well documented that HR2 peptides target a transient intermediate state (i.e. the pre-hairpin fusion intermediate), and as a consequence, the potency of these inhibitors depends not only on how tightly they bind, but on how rapidly they associate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref073">73</xref>]. Thus, our findings are consistent with the model diagrammed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold> that C34-conjugated coreceptors exploit physiologic trafficking of chemokine receptors to present HR2 peptides at the site of HIV-1 entry, and that the proximity of the C34-conjugated amino termini on CXCR4 or CCR5 is well positioned to interrupt formation of the 6-helix bundle and to take advantage of a kinetic window required for this structure to be generated.</p>

        <p>To inhibit HIV-1 fusion, an HR2 peptide conjugated to a cell surface molecule must be able to be presented to trimeric heptad repeat-1 domains (HR1) on gp41 that are exposed during formation of the pre-hairpin fusion intermediate and prior to its conformational transition to the 6-helix bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref075">75</xref>]. Membrane-associated structures of CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref077">77</xref>] and CCR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref078">78</xref>] have been resolved at the atomic level for CCR5 in association with the small molecule inhibitor maraviroc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref078">78</xref>] and for CXCR4 bound to a small molecule or a cyclic peptide antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref077">77</xref>] and the viral chemokine vMIP-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref076">76</xref>]. Although the amino termini of chemokine receptors play important roles in chemokine binding, a large number of N-terminal residues were missing in CXCR4 structures bound to vMIP-II and to US28 or CX3CL1 (i.e., 22 and 14 aminio acids, respectively), presumably due to its flexibility. Similarly, nearly the entire N-termini were also not resolved in the small molecule inhibitor-bound structures of CCR5 and CXCR4 (18 and 26 residues, respectively). Flexibility of the CXCR4 and CCR5 amino termini, which is a structural theme for many G-protein coupled receptors, likely plays a role in binding to gp120 by facilitating an interaction with the gp120 bridging sheet that forms following CD4 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref079">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref081">81</xref>]. As noted above and diagrammed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>, this flexibility, as well as the membrane-proximal positioning of the CXCR4 and CCR5 amino termini, could serve to present the C34 peptide to HR1 domains following the insertion of the proximal amino terminal gp41 fusion peptide into the cell membrane. Although structural information on this pre-hairpin fusion intermediate is lacking, modeling strongly suggests that a spatial relationship between the C34 peptide on the coreceptor amino terminus and the trimeric HR1 domain anchored in the cell membrane is favorable for such an interaction to occur (personal communication, Irina Kufareva, UCSD, San Diego, CA). Interestingly, when the C34 peptide was conjugated to the amino terminus of CD4, it exhibited considerably less potency in preventing fusion, even though this construct was competent for binding to CD4-specific mAb and initiating fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005983.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). It is likely that in this context the C34 peptide was poorly positioned on the more extended CD4 molecule and/or that gp120 binding itself prevented the peptide from accessing gp41 HR1 domains. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that in the context of an intermolecular interaction between the envelope glycoprotein trimer, CD4 and coreceptors, that the positioning of the C34 peptide and its tethering to a flexible domain on the anchoring chemokine receptor was critical for inhibiting fusion.</p>
        <p>HIV-1 peptides containing 36 or 46 amino acids from HR2 have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection in primary T cells when conjugated to membrane-associated scaffold proteins derived from the nerve growth factor receptor or CD34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref033">33</xref>]. The effect of these constructs has been proposed to result from inhibition of 6-helix bundle formation and viral entry following the insertion of gp41 fusion peptides into the target cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref029">29</xref>]. However, their antiviral activity has been shown to be dependent on high and stable levels of surface expression, which can vary considerably in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref034">34</xref>]. Although in human trials these constructs were well tolerated and non-immunogenic when transduced ex vivo in peripheral CD4 T cells and re-infused into patients, no selective advantage of transduced cells or antiviral effects were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref032">32</xref>]. In nonhuman primates infected with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) bearing an HIV-1 envelope, stem cells transduced with a C46-containing construct showed a modest survival advantage, although no antiviral effects were seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref035">35</xref>]. While a head to head comparison of these constructs with the C34-conjugated coreceptors described in this report has not been conducted, the stoichiometric relationship of one C34-conjugated coreceptor to several unconjugated coreceptors suggests a highly efficient mechanism of fusion inhibition. Interestingly, in primary CD4 T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and, particularly in humanized mice, the survival of CD4 T cells expressing C34-CXCR4 was greater than for C34-CCR5. Although there could be steric and/or structural attributes of the N-termini of these receptors that account for these differences, it is also possible that the level of C34-CXCR4 surface expression was greater over time in primary cells.</p>
        <p>To be efficacious in HIV-infected humans, T cells expressing C34-conjugated coreceptors that have been rendered resistant to HIV-1 infection will also need to exhibit physiologic functions that permit their expansion and persistence and the ability to promote effective adaptive immune responses. Peripheral blood CD4 T cells expressing C34-conjugated CCR5 or CXCR4 proliferated and exhibited levels of cytokines when stimulated by CD3/CD28-mediated T cell receptor activation that were identical to untransduced T cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s009">S7 Fig</xref></bold>). C34-conjugated coreceptors expressed on cell lines were also shown to mediate chemotaxis in response to their cognate chemokines, CCL4 for C34-CCR5 and CXCL12 for C34-CXCR4, although C34-CXCR4 appeared to be less efficient than wildtype CXCR4 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s004">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). It remains to be determined whether the ability to mediate chemotaxis would be advantageous to primary T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> or to what extent this function would affect the ability of these cells to provide help for adaptive immune responses. However, the potency of protection from HIV-1 infection conferred by these C34-conjugated coreceptors provides a rich opportunity for future studies to explore the full anti-viral potential of these cells. This question is of particular interest given possible antiviral effects observed during an interruption of anti-retroviral therapy in patients who received autologous CD4 T cells that had been rendered CCR5-negative and HIV-1 resistant (to R5-tropic isolates) by zinc-finger nuclease treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>In summary, these studies demonstrate a proof of concept that peptides from gp41 HR2 can be delivered to the precise sites of HIV-1 entry when conjugated to chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, with C34-conjugated CXCR4 conferring particularly potent, broad and durable protection from HIV-1 infection to primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in humanized mice. The ability to exploit the physiologic trafficking of coreceptors that are essential for HIV-1 entry, and spatial relationships of viral and cellular molecules that interact during fusion provide a novel approach to generate HIV-1 resistance.

        <title>Generation of C34-coreceptor and C34-CD4 expression constructs</title>
        <p>The HIV gp41 HR2 domain (C34) peptide sequence was conjugated to the N-terminus of CCR5, CXCR4, or CD4 with a two amino acids spacer. To generate the pVAX-C34-CXCR4 expressing construct, two paired oligonucleotide (oligo) sequences (C34-left-F1/R1 and C34-right-F1/R1, refer to <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005983.s002">S2 Table</xref></bold> for oligo sequences) were allowed to anneal to each other and then used as inserts to ligate into a NheI and AflII-digested pVAX-X4b construct, which is a pVAX plasmid (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with the CXCR4 isoform B cDNA cloned in. To generate the scrambled C34 with 4 mutated amino acids (SC34mut4 LLEQEDKEQENQAEEIISHLLSTFNNELRDFEMW), the two oligo pairs were replaced with SC34mut4-left-F1/R1 and SC34mut4-right-F1/R1. To generate the scramble C34 with 8 mutated amino acids (SC34mut8 LLEQEDKEQENQSEEILSHILSTYNNLERDFEMW), the two oligo pairs were replaced with SC34mut8-left-F1/R1and SC34mut8-right-F1/R1. To generate the pVAX-C34-CCR5 expressing construct, a pair of primers (R5 cDNA_F1/R1) were used to PCR amplify CCR5 cDNA (single exon) from genomic DNA (gDNA) of the Jurkat T cell line. The PCR product was digested with AflII and XhoI and ligated to pVAX-C34-CXCR4 digested with the same restriction enzymes. To generate the pVAX-C34-CD4 construct, the CD4 signal peptide portion was PCR amplified from a CD4 cDNA clone with a pair of primers (CD4sig_F1/R1) and then digested with SpeI and BsaI. The C34 portion was PCR amplified from the pVAX-C34-CXCR4 construct with a pair of primers (C34_F1/R1) and then digested with BsaI and EcoRI. The mature CD4 portion was PCR amplified from the CD4 cDNA clone with a pair of primers (CD4_cDNA_F1/R1) and then digested with EcoRI and Bgl2. The three parts described above were then ligated into pVAX plasmid digested with NheI and BglII.</p>
        <p>To generate C34 constructs for lenti production, we first introduced NheI and XbaI restriction sites to flank the GFP ORF portion of the pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.EGFP.wPRE construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref086">86</xref>] using a QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. The resultant pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.EGFP.wPRE-Nhe1Xba1 construct was digested with NheI and XbaI and ligated with inserts derived from C34-coreceptor constructs (pVAX-C34-CXCR4 or pVAX-C34-CCR5) digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.C34X4.wPRE or pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.C34R5.wPRE. To generate pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.C34CD4.wPRE, pVAX-C34-CD4 was digested with AseI and XbaI, blunted with DNA Polymerase I Klenow fragment, and then ligated to the digested and blunted pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.EGFP.wPRE vector to replace the EGFP portion. The pTRPE lentivirus vector is previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref050">50</xref>], and contains the EF1α promoter and cloning sites at 5’ (Nhe I site) and 3’ (Sal I site) ends. Both the C34-R5 and C34-X4 fragments were subcloned into pTRPE using 5’ Nhe1 and 3’ Sal1 sites.</p>
        <p>The pCCLSIN or pTRPE constructs described above were used to produce lentivirus, pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope, by transient co-transfection of four plasmids in 293T cells as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref087">87</xref>]. Expression of the transgene is driven by either the human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter in pCCLSIN vector or EF1α in pTRPE vector.</p>

To generate A66-derived stable cell lines, A66 cells were transduced with lentivirus to express either wild-type (pTRPE constructs) or C34 fused receptors (pCCLSIN.cPPT.hPGK.wPRE or pTRPE constructs). Receptor-expressing cells were then enriched/selected by either cell sorting or single cell cloning (limited dilution and expansion).</p>

NheI and SalI digested C34-CCR5 and C34-CXCR4 fragments from pCCL.SIN.cPPT.hPGK.WPRE were subcloned into these sites to make the pTRPE constructs. These lentiviral vectors were then transfected in 293T cells in six-well plates using 3 μg vector, 1 μg gag, 1 μg pol, and 0.5 μg VSV-Env plasmids with 20 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 1 h.

For experiments in which the ratio of C34-conjugated to unconjugated coreceptors was varied, the total amount of transfected DNA was maintained at 6 μg per well with parental pcDNA3.1 plasmid added, as needed, to maintain the same total input of DNA (e.g., for a ratio of 1.0 of C34-conjugated to unconjugated coreceptor, 3 μg of each coreceptor-containing plasmid were transduced; for a 0.1 ratio, 0.3 μg of C34-conjugated coreceptor, 3.0 μg of unconjugated coreceptor, and 2.7 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid were transfected). The transfected cells were incubated over night at 37°C and then plated in duplicate into 24-well plates with each coreceptor in duplicate.

        <p>Surface expression of C34-conjugated coreceptors on A66 cells was quantified by flow fluorimetry using rhodamine-labeled 5-Helix, an engineered partial mimetic of the gp41 6-helix bundle that lacks one of three HR2 domains and, consequently, binds with high affinity and specificity to HR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>]. A 5-Helix variant containing a C-terminal Cys residue was recombinantly expressed, purified, and conjugated to rhodamine-5-maleimide (Anaspec), as previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>]. Specific binding activity of 5-Helix-rhodamine was assessed through stoichiometric titrations using HR2-peptide C37 (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.65 pM). Briefly, 5-Helix-rhodamine (estimated concentration of 1 nM) was incubated with varying concentrations of C37 (5 pM—10 nM) for 2 hours at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each solution was individually loaded through the flow cell of a KinExA 3000 flow fluorimeter (Sapidyne Instruments). The flow cell contained azlactone-activated polyacrylamide beads (ThermoFisher) covalently conjugated to C37 peptide. The beads captured free (unbound) 5-Helix-rhodamine, resulting in a change in bead fluorescence (Δ<italic>f</italic>) that was directly proportional to the free 5-Helix concentration in solution. The C37-dependence to Δ<italic>f</italic> was fit using a general bimolecular binding model where the real concentration of 5-Helix-rhodamine was assumed to be unknown (Origin Software, OriginLabs):

TruCount analysis was performed using PerCP-Cy5.5 conjugated anti-human CD45 antibody (eBioscience), and BV421-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (eBioscience). Plasma was saved for viral load analysis when available in sufficient quantities for all animals. Animals were housed at the University of Pennsylvania. Serum viral loads were determined Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test (Children's Hospital, Philadelphia), using at least 10 μL of serum per animal.</p>

        <title>Enrichment of C34-conjugated coreceptors following HIV-1 infection.</title>
        <p>Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were transduced with GFP or with lentiviral vectors expressing C34-CCR5 or C34-CXCR4, diluted with untransduced cells to a final concentration of 25%, and inoculated with the indicated HIV-1 isolates. The percentage of viable cells expressing either GFP or the transduced coreceptor, as determined by flow cytometry using an anti-C34 monoclonal antibody, was determined on days 5 and 14 post inoculation. The fold increase in C34-expressing cells from the 25% starting point is shown for C34-CCR5 (yellow) and C34-CXCR4 transduced cells (pink) on day 14. A consistently greater increase expansion of C34-CXCR4 cells is seen (red) compared to C34-CCR5 cells (yellow). The average of 2 experiments with different donor cells for each virus is shown.</p>

        <title>5-Helix binding and quantifying surface expression levels of C34-conjugated coreceptors on A66 cells.</title>
        <p><bold>(A and B)</bold> A66 cells were incubated with rhodamine-labeled 5-Helix, an engineered protein that binds HR2-derived peptides with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005983.ref039">39</xref>]. Receptor-bound 5-Helix was removed by centrifugation, and the amount of 5-Helix remaining in supernatants assessed by flow fluorimetry (KinExA 3000, Sapidyne Instruments). Each sample was loaded through a flow cell containing HR2-peptide-coated beads that bind 5-Helix. The change in bead fluorescence (Δ<italic>f</italic>) measured before sample load and after washout was directly proportional to the amount of rhodamine-labeled 5-Helix in the supernatant. <bold>(C)</bold> Fluorescence traces obtained from incubations of 5-Helix (100 pM) with mixtures of C34-CXCR4-expressing and CXCR4-expressing A66 cells. A background signal (Δ<italic>f</italic><sub>min</sub>) was obtained by including enough HR2-peptide C37 (100 nM, K<sub>D</sub> = 0.65 pM) to bind all 5-Helix and block its interaction with beads in the flow cell (dashed trace). <bold>(D)</bold> Fluorescence signals (Δ<italic>f</italic>) obtained from incubations of 5-Helix (100 pM) with culture media only, parental A66 cells, A66 cells expressing CXCR4 with or without 100 nM of C37 peptide, and A66 cells expressing C34-conjugated CXCR4. The comparable Δ<italic>f</italic> values for culture media only, parental A66 and CXCR4-expressing A66 cells indicates that 5-Helix has minimal nonspecific interactions with A66 cells or CXCR4. The reduction in Δ<italic>f</italic> value for the C34-CXCR4-expressing A66 cells indicates a specific interaction between 5-Helix and the HR2-conjugated coreceptor. <bold>(E)</bold> Fluorescence signals (Δ<italic>f</italic>) measured for incubations of 5-Helix (100 pM) with increasing concentrations of C34-CXCR4-expressing A66 cells. Total cell concentration in each incubation was maintained at 2x10<sup>6</sup> using CXCR4-expressing A66 cells. The open square represents a measurement of Δ<italic>f</italic><sub>min</sub> from an incubation that included 100 mM C37 peptide (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). <bold>(F and G)</bold> Data are shown as in Panels D and E, except that C34-CCR5-expressing and CCR5-expressing A66 cells were interrogated. The data and error bars in Panels D through G represent the mean and range-of-mean of duplicate measurements of a single experiment. Δ<italic>f</italic> values in Panels E and G were fit (solid lines) to a general bimolecular binding model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) to determine the number of C34-conjugated coreceptors per A66 cell and approximate K<sub>D</sub> values. Experiments were repeated at least three times for both C34-CXCR4-expressing and C34-CCR5-expressing A66 cells, yielding average receptor densities of 55,000 ±13,000 and 52,000 ± 11,000 per cell, respectively, and K<sub>D</sub> values of approximately 4 ± 1 and 13 ± 6 pM, respectively.</p>

        <p>The control of RNA stability is a key determinant in cellular gene expression. The stability of any transcript is modulated through the activity of cis- or trans-acting regulatory factors as well as cellular quality control systems that ensure the integrity of a transcript. As a result, invading viral pathogens must be able to subvert cellular RNA decay pathways capable of destroying viral transcripts. Here we report that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF57 protein binds to a unique KSHV polyadenylated nuclear RNA, called PAN RNA, and protects it from degradation by cellular factors. ORF57 increases PAN RNA levels and its effects are greatest on unstable alleles of PAN RNA. Kinetic analysis of transcription pulse assays shows that ORF57 protects PAN RNA from a rapid cellular RNA decay process, but ORF57 has little effect on transcription or PAN RNA localization based on chromatin immunoprecipitation and in situ hybridization experiments, respectively. Using a UV cross-linking technique, we further demonstrate that ORF57 binds PAN RNA directly in living cells and we show that binding correlates with function. In addition, we define an ORF57-responsive element (ORE) that is necessary for ORF57 binding to PAN RNA and sufficient to confer ORF57-response to a heterologous intronless β-globin mRNA, but not its spliced counterparts. We conclude that ORF57 binds to viral transcripts in the nucleus and protects them from a cellular RNA decay pathway. We propose that KSHV ORF57 protein functions to enhance the nuclear stability of intronless viral transcripts by protecting them from a cellular RNA quality control pathway.</p>

        <p>In order to replicate efficiently, a virus must ensure that its genes are properly expressed in the context of an infected host cell. Recent work has demonstrated that eukaryotic cells have RNA quality control pathways that degrade improperly processed, aberrant RNAs. Our published findings using an unusual Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) nuclear RNA, called PAN RNA, have suggested that intronless polyadenylated transcripts are subject to such a quality control system. Because most KSHV genes lack introns, we hypothesized that KSHV must have evolved mechanisms that bypass this quality control system. In support of this idea, we show that the ORF57 protein, a multifunctional enhancer of KSHV gene expression, binds to and stabilizes PAN RNA. We further define an element called the ORF57-responsive element (ORE) in PAN RNA that is necessary for ORF57-binding and activity on PAN RNA. In addition, we show that the ORE is sufficient to confer ORF57-responsiveness to a heterologous intronless mRNA, but not its spliced counterpart. These observations substantiate the model that ORF57 enhances KSHV gene expression by protecting viral transcripts from host RNA surveillance pathways. More broadly, these data suggest that viruses producing intronless nuclear RNAs require mechanisms to evade host quality control mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Post-transcriptional events in mRNA biogenesis are of central importance to the fidelity and regulation of gene expression. Cellular factors regulate nearly every step of RNA metabolism including transcription elongation, RNA splicing, 3′ end formation, nuclear export, translation, etc. In fact, genome-wide profiling experiments demonstrate that a significant percent of the observed changes in RNA levels are dictated by regulation of the stability of a transcript rather than its transcription (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-RomeroSantacreu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Fan1">[2]</xref>). RNA half-life can be modulated directly, through the activities of regulatory stabilizing or destabilizing protein factors or small RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Beckham1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Anderson1">[5]</xref>. In addition, RNA quality control pathways ensure aberrant transcripts are less stable than their functional counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Doma1">[6]</xref>. Given the importance of these pathways for gene expression, it is no surprise that viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract pathways that otherwise would lead to the destruction of viral transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Beckham1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Sokoloski1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a member of the gammaherpesvirus family that causes Kaposi's sarcoma, a common AIDS-associated malignancy, as well as the lymphoproliferative disorders primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and some cases of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nicholas1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Dourmishev1">[10]</xref>. The life cycle of KSHV includes a latent phase in which the viral DNA is maintained in infected host cells as a circular episome. During latency, few viral genes are expressed and no viral replication occurs. When the KSHV lytic phase is reactivated, a well-regulated cascade of gene expression is initiated by the viral transactivator ORF50 (Rta) resulting in infectious virus production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Deng1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-West1">[13]</xref>. Like all herpesviruses, the KSHV genome is nuclear and its genes are expressed utilizing the host cell transcription, RNA processing, and translation machinery. In many respects, KSHV genes resemble those of their host; that is, they have canonical promoter elements, 3′-end formation signals, and consensus pre-mRNA splice sites.</p>
        <p>However, KSHV genes differ from canonical cellular genes in several relevant ways. Some transcripts are bicistronic, KSHV introns are smaller than the average size of a mammalian intron, and genes are more closely arranged in the genome than host genes. Most importantly for the present work, ∼70% of KSHV genes lack introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zheng1">[14]</xref>, whereas most human protein-coding genes contain multiple introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Sakharkar1">[15]</xref>. This difference in gene structure has implications for the expression of viral genes. The presence of an intron in a pre-mRNA and/or the changes in ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) composition that result from splicing promote the efficiency of almost every stage of gene expression, including transcription initiation and elongation, 3′-end formation, mRNA export, RNA localization, and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Damgaard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Valencia1">[27]</xref>. As a result, transgenes containing an intron are often expressed at significantly higher levels than those same genes lacking an intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-LeHir1">[18]</xref>. To compensate for the lack of introns or splicing, viruses that express unspliced or intronless transcripts have evolved mechanisms that promote efficient gene expression in the absence of splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Cullen1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>KSHV encodes a viral post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression called ORF57 (Mta, KS-SM) that is essential for viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Han1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak2">[35]</xref>. ORF57 is a member of a conserved family of herpesvirus proteins that post-transcriptionally enhance gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-SandriGoldin1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne1">[33]</xref>. ORF57 has been implicated in a variety of steps of RNA biogenesis from transcription to translation and it increases the efficiency of intronless gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Gupta1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>. ORF57 has been reported to interact with ORF50 and to enhance transcription in a promoter and cell-type specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Palmeri1">[39]</xref>. In addition, ORF57 binds cellular export factors and promotes the nuclear export of at least a subset of intronless viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak3">[43]</xref>. Unlike the herpes simplex homolog (HSV) ICP27, which contributes to host gene shut-off by inhibiting splicing, ORF57 promotes the splicing of some viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak4">[44]</xref>, and splicing activity is also seen with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ORF57 homolog, SM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Verma1">[45]</xref>. ORF57 has further been suggested to play a role in translation of an internal ribosome entry site-containing reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nishimura1">[46]</xref>. Thus, ORF57 is a multifunctional regulator of mRNA biogenesis that may, in part, compensate for the lack of introns in viral gene expression.</p>
        <p>ORF57 is critical for the accumulation of the polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA (nut1, T1.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Han1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref>, a non-coding nuclear transcript that accumulates to high levels during the lytic phase of viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Sun1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zhong1">[48]</xref>. The PAN RNA promoter is ORF50-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Song1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Chang1">[50]</xref>, and PAN RNA accumulation further depends on the activity of a 79-nucleotide (nt) RNA element, called the ENE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>. Mechanistically, the ENE interacts in cis with the poly(A) tail of PAN RNA resulting in the sequestration of the poly(A) tail from exonucleases. Detailed kinetic analysis of the effects of the ENE on PAN RNA decay in transfected cells showed that PAN RNA is subject to two kinetically distinguishable decay pathways, one with a very short half-life (10–20 min) and another with a longer half-life (3–5 hrs). ENE-lacking or ENE-mutant PAN transcripts are more likely to be degraded in the rapid RNA decay pathway than are their wild-type ENE containing counterparts. Because the ENE is sufficient to increase the nuclear accumulation of heterologous intronless transcripts, we further proposed that this rapid decay pathway is part of a nuclear RNA surveillance system that rapidly degrades inefficiently exported mRNAs.</p>
        <p>ORF57-mediated enhancement of the exclusively nuclear PAN RNA suggests that it may be involved in inhibiting the proposed RNA surveillance mechanism. Here, we test this idea and find that ORF57 stabilizes PAN RNA, particularly those transcripts that lack the ENE. We see no ORF57-dependent effect on RNA polymerase II (pol II) density on the PAN RNA gene nor does ORF57 lead to PAN RNA export. Therefore, we conclude that the observed stability enhancement constitutes the major effect of ORF57 on PAN RNA accumulation. In addition, ORF57 binds PAN RNA directly in vivo and a deletion of the 5′ portion of PAN RNA, dubbed the ORF57-responsive element (ORE), reduces ORF57 binding and ORF57 response. We show that tethering of ORF57 to an ORE-deleted PAN RNA restores ORF57-mediated up-regulation. Finally, we show that the ORE is sufficient to confer increased ORF57-response to a heterologous intronless β-globin mRNA, but not its spliced counterpart. We conclude that ORF57 protects viral transcripts from the same cellular RNA decay pathway that the ENE protects from in cis and that its stabilization activity is dependent on ORF57 binding to target RNAs.</p>

        <title>ORF57 protects transcripts from rapid decay</title>
        <p>If ORF57 protects transcripts from RNA decay pathways in vivo, we reasoned that the effects of ORF57 would be more pronounced on unstable ENE-lacking transcripts than on their ENE-containing counterparts. To test this idea, we compared the RNA levels of PAN RNA containing the ENE (PAN-WT) to PAN RNA lacking the ENE (PAN-Δ79) in the absence of ORF57 or in its presence. We transfected HEK293 cells with constructs that express PAN-WT or PAN-Δ79 and co-transfected ORF57-expression constructs at two concentrations or empty vector. After ∼18-24 hours, we extracted total RNA, and quantified relative RNA levels by northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Han1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref>, ORF57 increases wild-type PAN RNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 1–3). Quantitation of these data show that, at the highest ORF57 concentration tested, PAN RNA is ∼3.4-fold more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As predicted from our model, ENE-lacking transcripts show an even greater response to ORF57, ∼11-fold (lanes 4–6 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Because the ENE is involved in RNA stability, these results are consistent with the conclusion that ORF57 increases the half-life of PAN RNA.</p>

        <p>To directly examine the effects of ORF57 on PAN RNA half-life, we employed a transcription pulse strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Loflin1">[54]</xref>. In these experiments, we transfected HEK293 <underline>T</underline>et-<underline>o</underline>ff <underline>a</underline>dvanced (293TOA) cells with TRP-Δ79, a plasmid that expresses the ENE-lacking PAN-Δ79 transcript from a tetracycline-responsive promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad3">[52]</xref>. In 293TOA cells, transcription from this promoter is turned off in the presence of doxycycline (dox, a tetracycline analog), and is induced in its absence. In our initial experiments, we examined the effects of ORF57 on PAN RNA decay after a two-hour transcription pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, TRP-Δ79 RNA was undetectable prior to transcription pulse, but can be detected after two hours in dox-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, top panels). Examination of the decay profiles clearly shows an increase in RNA stability when ORF57 is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, top). Interestingly, the mobility of a portion of remaining transcripts after transcription shut-off is reduced while others show increased mobility. We have determined that these mobility changes are due to differences in poly(A) tail length (data not shown). The relationship between changes in poly(A) length and ORF57 function is currently under investigation and will be described elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). We also examined the effects of ORF57 on TRP-WT, a PAN expression construct containing the ENE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad3">[52]</xref>. However, in 293TOA cells this plasmid produced an extremely stable transcript (t<sub>1/2</sub>&gt;24hr), impractical for use in decay assays. Overall, these data demonstrate that ORF57 increases the half-life of unstable PAN RNA transcripts.</p>

        <p>Previous studies showed that PAN RNA is subject to two decay pathways with different kinetic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad3">[52]</xref>. That is, one pool of PAN RNA transcripts is degraded very rapidly with half-lives of ∼10-20 minutes, while another pool of transcripts is degraded more slowly (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼3-5hrs). The presence of the ENE appears to protect transcripts from the rapid decay system resulting in a decrease in the fraction of transcripts that are observed in this population. Consistent with these published findings, the decay profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2B</xref> are nicely fit by two-component exponential decay curves where the two components represent the two pools of transcripts. Using regression analysis, we can determine the decay parameters in PAN RNA degradation, including the fraction of transcripts undergoing rapid decay and the half-life of each population. Because ENE-lacking transcripts are preferentially up-regulated by ORF57, we predicted that, like the ENE, ORF57 expression would decrease the fraction of PAN transcripts in the rapid RNA decay pathway.</p>
        <p>To test this idea, we performed regression analysis of the data for TRP-Δ79 RNA decay in the presence or absence of ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000799.s001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000799.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Examination of the kinetic parameters shows that in the absence of ORF57, 73% of the transcripts are in the rapidly degrading population (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼7.8 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, only 51% of the transcripts are degraded rapidly when ORF57 is co-expressed, a statistically significant decrease. Because the more slowly degrading transcripts accumulate over time, the fraction of transcripts observed in the rapidly degrading pool decreases when longer transcription pulse times are employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>. If ORF57 decreases the fraction of transcripts that degrade rapidly, it follows that the observed rapidly degrading fraction would decrease more quickly when ORF57 is present. Indeed, the effects of ORF57 on TRP-Δ79 RNA decay are even more apparent after an 18-hour transcription pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In this case, the apparent half-life (i.e. the time difference at 50% remaining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) is increased ∼8-fold. More importantly, the percent of transcripts degrading rapidly in the presence of ORF57 is reduced to 15%, while 57% is rapidly degraded in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly argue that ORF57 enhances PAN RNA levels by protecting it from a rapid cellular RNA decay pathway.</p>

        <title>ORF57 up-regulation of PAN RNA occurs after transcription initiation</title>
        <p>Previous reports suggested that ORF57 enhances transcription rates of specific promoters in certain cell types, including the PAN RNA promoter in 293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Palmeri1">[39]</xref>. Even though we see an increase in PAN RNA half-life in the presence of ORF57, it remains possible that a significant portion of the up-regulation of PAN RNA by ORF57 is at the level of RNA synthesis rather than decay. To test the effects of ORF57 on transcription initiation, we initially examined the response of PAN RNA to ORF57 from three different promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with the results of others, PAN RNA expression from the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV<sub>IE</sub>) promoter is responsive to ORF57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Gupta1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kirshner1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Palmeri1">[39]</xref>. We extended this analysis by examining PAN RNA steady-state levels driven by the cellular elongation factor 1α (EF1α) and viral SV40 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Each of these constructs is 3′ processed using the PAN RNA cleavage and polyadenylation signals. For every promoter tested, ORF57 increased PAN RNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion supporting a post-transcriptional role for ORF57. Interestingly, the magnitude of the change differs among the constructs and this does not necessarily correlate with the strength of each promoter. For example, as judged by overall RNA levels, the PAN and SV40 promoters are the strongest and weakest promoters, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000799.s003">Figure S2</xref>). However, PAN-WT RNA driven by each of these promoters is increased by similar margins at the highest ORF57 expression levels (3.5-fold and 2.8-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the CMV<sub>IE</sub> and EF1α promoters both show greater increases in steady-state levels in response to ORF57 (9.5 and 6.7-fold, respectively). These data suggest that the effect of ORF57 on PAN RNA is not due to any promoter-specific element, but that magnitude of the ORF57 enhancement may be linked to a qualitative difference in these promoters.</p>

        <p>To further test the effects of ORF57 on PAN RNA transcription, we examined the pol II density on the PAN RNA gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP). In these experiments, ChIP was performed using antibodies to RNA polymerase II and the relative levels of co-immunoprecipitating DNA were compared. We examined DNA from the 5′ and 3′ ends of PAN RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) to assess polymerase density across the PAN gene. First, we determined the relative polymerase density on TRP-Δ79 in the presence and absence of ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and saw only a slight increase in polymerase density on either the 5′ or 3′ portion of the PAN gene when ORF57 was co-expressed (∼1.3-fold). As expected, in the presence of dox, the polymerase density significantly decreases. Second, we assayed polymerase density on the PAN RNA gene when transcription is driven from the PAN promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Because this promoter depends on the ORF50 viral transactivator, we included samples lacking ORF50 as negative controls. Comparing samples containing or lacking ORF57, we observed little difference in polymerase density at the 5′ end of the PAN gene. Similarly, we saw minimal ORF57-dependent difference in signal from the 3′ end of PAN gene, although there is lower signal in this sample (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that the predominant effect of ORF57 on PAN RNA steady-state levels occurs subsequent to transcription initiation.</p>

        <title>ORF57 does not induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of PAN RNA</title>
        <p>ORF57, like its homologs in other herpesviruses, has been implicated in the nuclear export of intron-lacking viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-SandriGoldin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Swaminathan1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Toth1">[55]</xref>. Because the machinery involved in RNA decay differs between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, it stands to reason that a change in subcellular localization would affect RNA decay profiles. Therefore, we performed in situ hybridization to verify that PAN RNA remains nuclear in the presence of ORF57. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g004">Figure 4</xref>, PAN-Δ79 RNA localizes to faint spots in the nucleus (top panels), with a few cells demonstrating a more diffuse pattern (data not shown and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000799.s004">Figure S3</xref>). In the presence of ORF57, PAN-Δ79 RNA is also observed strictly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g004">Figure 4</xref>, middle panels). The signal intensity, the number of cells showing signal above background, and the percentage of cells with diffuse nuclear staining were all increased in the presence of ORF57 and account for the higher levels of PAN-Δ79 in the presence of ORF57 (data not shown). Importantly, no cytoplasmic PAN RNA signal was detected. In addition, TRP-Δ79 RNA was observed exclusively in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000799.s004">Figure S3</xref>), as was wild-type PAN RNA driven from either the PAN or TRP promoters (data not shown). As an additional control, since many in situ hybridization protocols will “wash away” cytoplasmic RNA, we tested whether we could detect cytoplasmic signal by examining the localization of a spliced β-globin reporter mRNA. In this case, cytoplasmic signal was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panels). These results demonstrate that the increase in PAN RNA stability in the presence of ORF57 is not the result of PAN RNA export to the cytoplasm. Because ORF57 enhances RNA stability, but has little or no effect on PAN RNA export or transcription, we conclude that the effect of ORF57 on PAN RNA accumulation is the result of increased nuclear RNA stability.</p>

        <title>ORF57 binds PAN RNA directly in living cells</title>
        <p>ORF57 could stabilize PAN RNA by one of two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, ORF57 may inhibit the activity of RNA decay enzymes, either by binding and inactivating them directly or by decreasing their expression. Second, ORF57 may interact with transcripts and protect the bound RNAs, directly or indirectly, from decay enzymes. The second model predicts that ORF57 is in a complex with PAN RNA and that this binding is necessary for protection by ORF57. Even though a previous report suggested that ORF57 did not bind to PAN RNA in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak5">[56]</xref>, we investigated whether ORF57 bound to PAN RNA in vivo.</p>
        <p>One difficulty in examining RNA-protein interactions using co-immunoprecipitation techniques is that RNA-protein complexes frequently reassort in cellular extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad5">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Mili1">[58]</xref>. That is, an RNA-binding protein will associate with specific transcripts in an extract that were not bound in vivo. Therefore, in order to conclude that an RNA-protein interaction occurs in cells, it is imperative to test whether a given RNA-protein complex forms subsequent to lysis. To do this, we employed a “cell-mixing” experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad5">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Mili1">[58]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We induced lytic reactivation of KSHV in HH-B2 cells, a latently infected PEL cell line, with sodium butyrate (NaB) to initiate the expression of lytic genes including PAN RNA. After 24 hours, we mixed the lytically reactivated cells with HEK293 cells transfected with Flag-tagged ORF57 (Fl-ORF57) or with untagged ORF57 expression constructs. After combining intact cells, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Flag antibodies. PAN RNA, which is exclusively derived from the HH-B2 cells, was efficiently and specifically immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Because PAN RNA is not produced in the same cells as the Fl-ORF57, this result clearly indicates that ORF57 interacts with RNAs in cell lysate and that RNAs that co-immunoprecipitate with ORF57 do not necessarily reflect RNP composition in vivo. As a result, caution must be taken in the interpretation and experimental design of RNA immunoprecipitation experiments with ORF57.</p>

        <p>To control for ORF57-RNA reassortment in cell extract, we employed an ultraviolet light (UV) cross-linking protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad5">[57]</xref>. We transfected HEK293 cells with PAN-WT and Fl-ORF57 or untagged ORF57 expression plasmids and exposed the cells to UV light to covalently cross-link protein to RNA. Cells were lysed under stringent conditions and ORF57 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies. Subsequently, we detected PAN RNA signal by northern blot and quantitated this signal as a percent of input RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). Using this procedure, PAN RNA is immunoprecipitated from extracts containing Fl-ORF57, but not the untagged control (compare lanes 5 and 6, top panel). Most importantly, because living cells were exposed to UV, a UV-dependent interaction reflects an interaction in cells. Because the “no UV” control shows little detectable signal (lane 4), we conclude that ORF57 associates with PAN RNA in cells. Moreover, UV cross-linking is limited to interactions in which the RNA and protein are in close contact, so we can further conclude that ORF57 binds directly to PAN RNA in vivo.</p>
        <p>Little is known about the requirements for ORF57 recruitment or RNA-binding in vivo, so we tested whether cis-acting elements in PAN RNA are necessary for the ORF57-PAN RNA interactions. We utilized a series of four previously described PAN RNA expression constructs with 300-nt overlapping deletions in PAN RNA, called PANΔ1-Δ4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>. ORF57 cross-linked to PANΔ2, PANΔ3, and PANΔ4 with similar efficiency as PAN-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g005">Figures 5C and 5D</xref>). In contrast, cross-linking to PANΔ1 RNA was only slightly higher than background signal. We previously reported that PANΔ1 RNA is expressed at lower levels than PAN-WT RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref> (see below). To verify that the lower expression of PANΔ1 was not responsible for its lack of ORF57 binding, we performed experiments in which we transfected less of the PAN-WT expression plasmid, to render its steady-state levels similar levels to PANΔ1 (data not shown). In this case, efficient binding to PAN-WT was maintained, so we conclude that reduced ORF57-PANΔ1 cross-linking is not due to lower PANΔ1 expression levels. These results demonstrate that sequences near the 5′ end of PAN RNA are necessary for efficient cross-linking of ORF57 to PAN RNA in cultured cells.</p>

        <title>ORF57 binding correlates with ORF57 activity</title>
        <p>The model that ORF57-RNA interactions are required for activity predicts that diminished binding of ORF57 to PANΔ1 will result in decreased ORF57 activity. Therefore, we examined the accumulation of PANΔ1 in the presence of increasing amounts of ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Under the same conditions in which ORF57 increases PAN-WT by 3.4-fold and PAN-Δ79 by 11-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we observe no statistically significant change in PANΔ1 levels in the presence of ORF57. Thus, the loss of ORF57 binding to PANΔ1 correlates with loss of PAN RNA up-regulation. Taken with data presented below, our results show that the 5′ end of PAN RNA (nt 1–312) contains an ORF57-responsive element (ORE).</p>

        <p>The loss of binding of ORF57 to PANΔ1 could be due to any one of several non-mutually exclusive models. For example, the ORE may contain a high-affinity binding site for ORF57. Alternatively, there may be a cis-acting sequence in the ORE whose activity is necessary for ORF57 function. As a result, loss of this cis-acting sequence disrupts the ORF57 up-regulatory pathway. Consistent with this idea, previously published data suggested that nt 13–312 contain an activity important for PAN RNA accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether ORF57-responsiveness correlates with the RNA accumulation activity provided by this region of PAN RNA. Using northern blots (data not shown), we confirmed that PANΔ1 is expressed at ∼5-fold lower levels than PAN-WT when ORF57 is not co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, when PANΔ1 is placed behind a CMV<sub>IE</sub> promoter (CMV-Δ1), the expression levels are reduced only slightly, ∼30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, this cis-acting PAN RNA accumulation activity found in nt 13–312 is not operative when a CMV<sub>IE</sub> promoter is used to express PAN RNA. Using the CMV<sub>IE</sub>-driven PANΔ1 constructs, we next tested the hypothesis that this activity is related to ORF57-responsiveness. Quantitation of northern blot data show that CMV<sub>IE</sub>-driven PANΔ1 remains significantly less responsive to ORF57 than CMV<sub>IE</sub>-driven wild-type PAN RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). CMV<sub>IE</sub>-driven WT PAN was up-regulated nearly 10-fold in the presence of ORF57, while the CMV<sub>IE</sub>-driven PANΔ1 RNA levels increase by a factor of only ∼2-fold. Therefore, we conclude that the lack of ORF57-responsiveness of PANΔ1 is unrelated to its reduced levels from the PAN promoter. Moreover, these data show that the ORE functions in a promoter-independent fashion.</p>

        <title>ORF57 binding is sufficient to restore up-regulation to PANΔ1</title>
        <p>Loss of ORF57 binding to PAN RNA correlates with loss of function, supporting the model that RNA-binding is necessary for ORF57 responsiveness. We next tested whether restoration of ORF57-binding was sufficient to restore ORF57-responsiveness to PANΔ1. To do this, we employed a tethering system using the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein, which binds with high affinity to a well-defined bacteriophage RNA hairpin sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-LykkeAndersen1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Coller1">[60]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We expressed an amino-terminal fusion of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein with ORF57 (NMS2-NLS-Fl-ORF57) and verified that the fusion did not abrogate ORF57 activity on CMV-driven full-length PAN RNA (lanes 1–8). Expression of this construct increases PAN RNA accumulation similarly to Fl-ORF57, (compare lanes 4 and 5 with 2 and 3), while expression of the MS2-NLS-Fl protein alone did not increase PAN RNA levels (lanes 6 and 7). Therefore, we conclude that NMS2-NLS-Fl-ORF57 maintains ORF57 activity. Next, we co-expressed NMS2-NLS-Fl-ORF57 fusion protein with a CMV-Δ1 derivative that includes six binding sites for the MS2 coat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g007">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 12,13). In this case, PAN RNA levels increase ∼7-fold. Expression of neither Fl-ORF57 nor MS2-NLS-Fl alone had a similar effect (lanes 10–11 and 14–15, respectively). Importantly, the increase depends on the presence of MS2-binding sites in the RNA: CMV-Δ1 shows minimal response to MS2-NLS-Fl-ORF57 expression (lanes 20, 21). Thus, tethering of ORF57 to PANΔ1 transcripts can complement the lack of ORF57-responsiveness of PANΔ1. We conclude that the stabilization of PAN RNA by ORF57 depends on direct interactions between ORF57 and its target RNA.</p>

While wild-type β-globin contains two introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, β-wt), these reporters delete either the first (βΔ1) or both (βΔ1,2) β-globin introns.

We co-transfected these constructs with the Fl-ORF57 expression plasmid and monitored β-globin mRNA levels by northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, lanes 1–15). Two different schemes were used to normalize the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). First, to show the response of each mRNA variant to Fl-ORF57, we normalized the β-globin mRNA signal in the presence of Fl-ORF57 to the signal from the same construct in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, top). Second, we normalized all the data to the βΔ1,2 plus 0.4 µg ORF57 (lane 3) to yield information about the expression levels of the reporter mRNAs relative each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, bottom).</p>

        <p>Our data conclusively demonstrate that the ORE increases the response of intronless β-globin mRNA to ORF57. In the absence of any PAN fragment, ORF57 increases the expression levels of intronless β-globin mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion reaching ∼4-fold at the highest ORF57 levels tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8B</xref> lane 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). When PF1, which contains the ORE, is placed in the β-globin 3′ UTR, ORF57 has an even greater effect: βΔ1,2-PF1 transcripts are up-regulated ∼23-fold. This effect is specific to PF1 because PF2, PF3, PF4 do not increase ORF57 response. As previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>, the ENE-containing insert (PF4, lanes 13–15) increases the levels of intronless β-globin mRNA. However, as in the case of PAN RNA, ORF57-responsiveness decreases (∼2-fold) when the ENE is included in the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These data show that the ORE is sufficient to confer increased response to ORF57 in a heterologous context. Because the ORE was inserted into the β-globin 3′ UTR, we can further conclude that ORE activity is not strictly dependent upon being at the 5′ end of the transcript.</p>
        <p>Published data suggest that intronless mRNAs are subject to degradation by a cellular RNA quality control system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zhao1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Wang1">[62]</xref> and the data presented above support the model that ORF57 protects transcripts from this RNA decay pathway. If this is the case, we reason that ORF57 should have a limited effect on spliced mRNA abundance, even if the mRNAs contain the ORE, because spliced transcripts are not subject to the cellular RNA quality control pathway. To test this idea, we examined the effects of ORF57 on spliced β-globin mRNA levels containing (βΔ1-PF1) or lacking (βΔ1) the ORE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Quantitation of β-globin mRNA accumulation by northern blot showed that neither of these mRNAs was significantly altered by ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, lanes 16–21, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Examination of the RNA levels shows that the spliced mRNAs accumulate to higher levels than the mRNAs generated from intronless genes, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, bottom). Interestingly, the levels of the ORE-containing intronless transcripts approach those of the spliced mRNAs under the highest levels of ORF57. These results are consistent with the model that ORF57 protects viral mRNAs from cellular RNA decay factors that preferentially degrade transcripts generated from intronless genes.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>In this report we uncover three novel findings about the ORF57 protein, an essential KSHV protein involved in viral gene expression. First, these data establish a role for ORF57 in stabilizing nuclear transcripts. Second, our data show that ORF57 binds directly to its target, PAN RNA, in living cells and that binding correlates with function. Third, ORF57 and its homologs can increase the expression of a variety of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne1">[33]</xref>, suggesting a relatively nonspecific effect. However, here we demonstrate the existence of an ORF57-responsive element in PAN RNA suggesting that, at least in some cases, specific cis-acting sequences have evolved to recruit ORF57 to its targets. Consistent with previous reports, our data further show that ORF57 primarily enhances transcript accumulation from intron-lacking genes but not from intron-containing genes, even when the ORE is included in the spliced transcript. Together, these data are consistent with a model in which ORF57 binds to intronless viral transcripts and protects them from a cellular RNA quality control pathway.</p>
        <p>The data presented here demonstrate ORF57 stabilizes nuclear RNAs that would otherwise be rapidly degraded. Using steady-state analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and a transcription pulse assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we show that ORF57 increases the stability of an unstable polyadenylated nuclear RNA. Kinetic analysis further supports the conclusion that ORF57 is protecting RNAs, at least in part, from the same rapid RNA decay pathway that the ENE protects transcripts from in cis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad3">[52]</xref>. Even though ORF57 has been implicated in mRNA export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref>, its expression does not lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of PAN RNA. Thus, we conclude that the effect of ORF57 on RNA stability is independent of its proposed function in RNA export. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports implying that ORF57 stabilizes its target RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Palmeri1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref> and with the observations that ORF57 homologs SM and ICP27 can stabilize specific transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nicewonger1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Corcoran1">[64]</xref>. However, these data are the first direct demonstration that KSHV ORF57 increases the half-lives of nuclear RNAs and that his function is separable from its proposed roles in mRNA export, transcription, and translation.</p>
        <p>We observe only a slight increase in polymerase density on PAN RNA genes driven from either the PAN or tetracycline-responsive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we conclude ORF57 increases PAN RNA levels primarily by a post-transcriptional mechanism. We were surprised at the lack of increase in pol II density on the constructs driven by the PAN promoter, which binds the viral transactivator ORF50, an ORF57-interacting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Malik1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Palmeri1">[39]</xref>. Assuming these proteins associate in our experimental system, the interaction appears to have little effect on transcription initiation. It should be noted that we used an antibody (8WG16) that preferentially recognizes the initiating hypophosphorylated form of pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Patturajan1">[65]</xref>. Thus, it remains possible that a hyperphosphorylated elongating form of pol II increases on the PAN RNA gene in response to ORF57. Taken with the observation that PAN RNA is up-regulated by ORF57 from four different promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), our data strongly support the conclusion that transcription initiation is unaffected by ORF57.</p>
        <p>ORF57 enhances the expression of viral mRNAs, the noncoding nuclear PAN RNA, and heterologous reporter mRNAs, so it appeared that its effects were not strongly influenced by cis-acting sequences. On the contrary, our data demonstrate that a specific cis-acting sequence, the ORE, can enhance the effects of ORF57 on both PAN RNA and on a β-globin reporter mRNA. Using a previously described set of deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>, we show that ORF57 has reduced binding to PANΔ1 RNA and that this correlates with loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, we placed the ORE into an intronless β-globin mRNA and found that it enhances ORF57-responsiveness by ∼5-fold, demonstrating that the ORE affects mRNAs as well as the noncoding PAN RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Tethering ORF57 to the ORE-lacking PANΔ1 transcripts in cells is sufficient to complement the ORE deletion, so it seems likely that ORF57 recruitment resides at the core of ORE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The simplest interpretation of these results is that the ORE is a high-affinity ORF57-binding site, and that RNA binding by ORF57 is necessary for its stabilization activity. Interestingly, intronless β-globin mRNA levels are enhanced by ORF57 ∼4-fold in the absence of the ORE. Perhaps ORF57 has enough non-specific RNA-binding activity to account for its general effects on reporter RNAs. Alternatively, this effect may be linked to a separate ORF57 activity that functions independently of RNA binding.</p>
        <p>Mechanistically, our data support the model that ORF57 binds to its RNA targets and inhibits the activity of nuclear RNA decay enzymes, but we do not yet know the molecular details of ORF57-mediated RNA stabilization. In one model, ORF57 binds RNA making it inaccessible to RNA decay enzymes. Alternatively, ORF57 could indirectly stabilize transcripts by promoting changes in RNP composition or conformation. It remains formally possible that ORF57 increases PAN RNA stability by retaining the transcripts in the nucleus, thereby protecting them from cytoplasmic decay enzymes. However, given the reported role of ORF57 in mRNA export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne2">[40]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Nekorchuk1">[42]</xref> and its ability to shuttle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Bello1">[66]</xref>, we think this last hypothesis is unlikely.</p>
        <p>Our data are consistent with the model that ORF57 counteracts a nuclear RNA quality control pathway that rapidly degrades transcripts that derived from intronless genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zhao1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Wang1">[62]</xref>. It is important to point out that this model does not depend on cells specifically recognizing intronless RNAs. Rather, because of the extensive coupling between the steps of cellular RNA biogenesis including pre-mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Damgaard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Valencia1">[27]</xref>, we believe it more likely that intronless RNAs are inefficiently processed. If RNA surveillance and RNA maturation are in kinetic competition as formally proposed by Doma and Parker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Doma1">[6]</xref>, these inefficiently processed intronless transcripts would be predicted to be subject to degradation by RNA quality control pathways. Because the majority of KSHV genes are intronless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zheng1">[14]</xref>, we propose that ORF57 functions to counteract this RNA decay pathway to promote the robust expression of viral genes. ORF57 has been reported to promote the export of intronless viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Boyne2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak3">[43]</xref>, so it is easy to imagine that ORF57 allows mRNAs to bypass nuclear decay systems by enhancing the efficiency of their export. However, in the case of PAN RNA, we can uncouple ORF57 mRNA export activities from its function in RNA stabilization. Therefore, our data suggest a more active role for ORF57 in protecting transcripts from degradation in the nucleus. Current work focuses on further testing this model by identifying the cellular decay machinery involved as well as the viral RNAs bound and protected by ORF57.</p>
        <p>Because PAN RNA accumulates to such high levels in KSHV lytically reactivated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Sun1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Zhong1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Song1">[49]</xref>, it likely performs an important function for the virus. Therefore, studying the biogenesis of this unusual transcript is essential to understanding KSHV biology. In addition, PAN RNA provides a useful a tool to separate ORF57 functions in RNA stability from its role in RNA export. We used an unstable ENE-lacking PAN RNA for our decay studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but several observations suggest an important role for ORF57 in PAN RNA biogenesis in infected cells. First, steady-state levels of PAN RNA containing the ENE are up-regulated in the presence of ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g003">3</xref>). Second, published reports have shown that ORF57-deleted bacmids produce reduced levels of PAN RNA during lytic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Han1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Majerciak2">[35]</xref>. Finally, we have observed that insertion of multiple copies of the ENE leads to higher levels of PAN RNA (unpublished observations) or βΔ1,2 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad4">[53]</xref> than insertion of one ENE, suggesting that a single ENE does not completely block RNA degradation. Thus, the proposed overlapping activities of the ENE and ORF57 may both be essential to fully stabilize PAN RNA during lytic replication. Perhaps more importantly, our studies provide insights into the possible mechanism of ORF57 activity on the accumulation of intronless viral transcripts that lack ENE-like elements. However, further experimentation is necessary to test the role that ORF57 plays on PAN RNA stability in the context of viral infection and on the stability of intronless viral mRNAs.</p>
        <p>A particularly interesting component of ORF57-mediated RNA stabilization is the role of the poly(A) tail in regulation of transcript stability. After transcription shut-off in the presence of ORF57, we found that some transcripts become hyperadenylated, while others are partially deadenylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2</xref>, data not shown). Because both the hypo- and hyperadenylated PAN transcripts are present 8 hrs subsequent to transcription shut-off, it seems that ORF57 stabilizes both forms. Indeed, when we over-expose our northern blots, we observe transcripts resembling these hyper- and hypoadenylated forms in the samples from cells lacking ORF57, but at significantly reduced levels (data not shown). Several different non-exclusive roles for the poly(A) tail in nuclear RNA stability can be imagined that are consistent with our observations. In the first model, PAN RNA is recognized by the cell as an aberrant transcript, presumably due to its lack of export. In manner analogous to yeast and bacterial systems, hyperadenylation of the transcripts is linked to quality control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Anderson2">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Kushner1">[68]</xref>. Interestingly, the host-shutoff mechanism employed by KSHV appears to involve destabilization of hyperadenylated cellular mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Lee1">[69]</xref>. Moreover, recent work implicates mRNA export factors as regulators of poly(A) length in cells and in polyadenylation assays performed in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Qu1">[70]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Hilleren2">[73]</xref>. In the second model, ORF57 promotes polyadenylation, which then leads to greater transcript stability. In a third model, ORF57 stabilizes nuclear PAN RNA, and the hyperadenylation results from promiscuous polyadenylation of the stabilized nuclear transcripts. Distinguishing among these models will shed light into host-virus interactions between KSHV ORF57, cellular poly(A) machinery, and cellular RNA decay pathways.</p>

Transfections were performed using TransIT-293 reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Mirus). Most ORF57 titration experiments were performed in 12-well tissue culture plates with a total of 0.7–0.8 µg plasmid DNA. A typical transfection with PAN-promoter constructs contained 0.15 µg of the PAN construct, 0.15 µg of an ORF50 expression construct, which is necessary for transcription from the PAN promoter, 0.1 µg of a control (mgU2-19/30) and 0.4 µg of Fl-ORF57 plus pcDNA3.

        <p>For ChIP assays, one 10 cm plate of HEK293 cells was used (∼10<sup>7</sup> cells) per sample. Twenty-four hours post-transfection (plus/minus dox as indicated), methanol-free formaldehyde was added to the media at final concentration of 0.75%. Plates were incubated for 10 min and formaldehyde was quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. After washing three times in ice-cold 1X phosphate buffered saline (Sigma), cells were harvested with a rubber policeman and collected by centrifugation at 3500×g for 3 min. Pellets were resuspended in 500 ml RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with 1X protease inhibitors (cocktail V, Calbiochem), and 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF), sonicated 6 times for 5 seconds using a Branson Sonifier 450 with a 4.8 mm diameter micro tip producing an average DNA size of ∼250–1000 bp. The extracts were then centrifuged at 800×g for 5 minutes at 4° and the supernatant was pre-cleared for one hour with 20 µl of Protein-A agarose (Pierce). After centrifugation to remove the beads, absorbance 260 was determined. While this does not accurately reflect DNA concentration due to the complexity of the extract, the value can be used to equilibrate extract concentrations for immunoprecipitation (5% was placed at −20° as “input”. Approximately 8 µg of 8WG16 antibody (Abcam) was added to extract (except no antibody control) and the mixture was nutated overnight at 4°. In addition, 20 µl of Protein-A agarose were blocked overnight at 4° with 0.5 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in RIPA. The next day, the beads were added to the antibody-extract mixture and the nutated for 1.5 hr at 4°. The beads were then washed a total of six times by nutating at room temperature for 3 minutes in 1 mL of the following solutions: 1) RIPA, 2) low salt wash (0.1 SDS, 1% TritonX100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM TRIS (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl), 3) high salt wash (0.1 SDS, 1% TritonX100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM TRIS (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl), 4) LiCl wash (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0), 5) TE (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), 6) TE. After washing, the beads were nutated in 150 mL of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.0) for 15 min. The elution step was repeated, the eluted fractions were combined, 60 µl 1M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) was added to the eluted complexes, proteinase K was added to 0.2 mg/ml and the samples were incubated at 37° for 60 min. The crosslinks were subsequently reversed at 65° for 5–18 hr. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform isoamyl alcohol (25∶24∶1), ethanol precipitated in the presence of 0.3M sodium acetate and 20 µg GlycoBlue (Ambion). The pellets washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 µl of water.</p>

        <title>Real-time PCR and quantitation of ChIP assays</title>
        <p>Input and pellet DNA was diluted 1∶100 and 1∶5, respectively and 2 ml of this was used as template for a 20 µl real-time PCR reaction containing iTAQ fast SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad) with a final concentration of 100 nM primers. Real-time PCR parameters were 40 cycles of 95° for 3 sec and 60° for 30 sec using a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers used were: PAN 5′, NC527 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CGCCGATTGTGGGTTGA</named-content> 3′) and NC528 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′CGAAAGCCAGGATGGGTATATT 3′</named-content>); PAN 3′, NC550 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGTTTTAATGTGTATGTTGTGTTGGAAGT</named-content> 3′) and NC551 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTCACCTACAAGAAAACATCGTTAGTC</named-content> 3′); GAPDH, NC533 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATGGAAATCCCATCACCATCTT</named-content> 3′) and NC534 (5′ <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTAGTTGCCTCCCCAAAGCA</named-content> 3′). Efficiency of the PAN 5′, PAN 3′ and GAPDH amplification was determined to be 80%, 63%, and 72%, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Pfaffl1">[76]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Quantitation of the ChIP signals was performed as follows. First, the relative quantities of Inputs and Pellets for each experiment were determined based on their amplification efficiency and the pellet/input ratio was determined. Each experiment included a “no antibody” control and this pellet/input value was subtracted from the other three samples. Subsequently, the background corrected pellet/input PAN 5′ and PAN 3′ ratios were normalized to the corresponding GAPDH ratios for the same experiment and the “no ORF57” values were set to one. The p-values reported throughout the manuscript are unpaired equal variance Student's t-test values.</p>

        <p>Kinetic parameters of PAN RNA decay data. (A) Percentage of PAN RNA transcripts in the “slow” decay pathway is shown with standard deviation. These values are effectively the inverse of those displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000799-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. (B) and (C) are the half-lives determined of the slow and rapid RNA decay pathways, respectively. As previously observed in experiments comparing transcripts containing or lacking the ENE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000799-Conrad2">[51]</xref>, the only parameter consistently significantly affected by ORF57 is the fraction of PAN RNA degrading in each population. Whether the lack of significant differences in half-life determinations between the two pools is due to experimental limitations or reflects a biological phenomenon requires further exploration. Clearly, our data show that the fraction of PAN RNA transcripts that are rapidly degraded decreases when ORF57 is co-expressed.</p>

        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Information on costs associated with malaria in pregnancy (MiP) in low transmission areas where <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> predominates is so far missing. This study estimates health system and patient costs of MiP in the Brazilian Amazon.</p>

        <sec id="sec002">
        <title>Methods/Principal Findings</title>
        <p>Between January 2011 and March 2012 patient costs for the treatment of MiP were collected through an exit survey at a tertiary referral hospital and at a primary health care centre in the Manaus metropolitan area, Amazonas state. Pregnant and post-partum women diagnosed with malaria were interviewed after an outpatient consultation or at discharge after admission. Seventy-three interviews were included in the analysis. Ninety-six percent of episodes were due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and 4% to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. In 2010, the total median costs from the patient perspective were estimated at US $45.91 and US $216.29 for an outpatient consultation and an admission, respectively. When multiple <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> infections during the same pregnancy were considered, patient costs increased up to US $335.85, representing the costs of an admission plus an outpatient consultation. Provider direct and overhead cost data were obtained from several sources. The provider cost associated with an outpatient case, which includes several consultations at the tertiary hospital was US $103.51 for a <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria episode and US $83.59 for a <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria episode. The cost of an inpatient day and average admission of 3 days was US $118.51 and US $355.53, respectively. Total provider costs for the diagnosis and treatment of all malaria cases reported in pregnant women in Manaus in 2010 (N = 364) were US $17,038.50, of which 92.4% (US$ 15,741.14) due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is associated with maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. In addition to the clinical burden, MiP implies a significant economic burden, but the little available evidence on the economics of MiP is limited to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria and to the sub-Saharan region. While an increasing interest has been recently devoted to the epidemiology and the clinical consequences of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, the economics of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria is neglected. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> is endemic in Latin America, and Brazil is the country with the highest reported burden of MiP of the American continent. Between 2011 and 2012, we conducted a study in the city of Manaus, Brazilian Amazon, with the aim of estimating costs associated with MiP both from the health provider and the patient perspectives. Despite being an area of low transmission risk, we found that the costs of treating MiP are not negligible. In particular, both from the patient and the provider perspectives, costs underwent a remarkable increase when admission was required and when the cost of subsequent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria episodes during the same pregnancy occurred. The information generated may help health policy decisions for the current control and future elimination of malaria in the area.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is associated with maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref001">1</xref>]. Among the clinical consequences of MiP are maternal anemia, low birth weight, prematurity, severe disease, and malaria morbidity in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition to the clinical burden, MiP implies a significant economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref007">7</xref>], but the little available evidence on the economics of MiP is limited to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria and to the sub-Saharan region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
        <p>In Brazil, malaria risk is mostly restricted to the Amazon region (99%), and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> is the predominant species, responsible for 84% of malaria cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref009">9</xref>]. The Brazilian National Malaria Control Program relies on prompt diagnosis and treatment of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref010">10</xref>]. Malaria is a notifiable disease and every confirmed case has to be reported through the National Surveillance System (SIVEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref010">10</xref>]. Information on pregnancy status is collected for any malaria case reported in women of reproductive age. Although these figures may be overestimated for Brazil as MiP cases are underreported in the continent, in 2008 Brazil notified the 75% (4315/5740) of MiP reported cases in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref011">11</xref>]. Of these, 571 were reported in the Manaus metropolitan area, representing over 13% of the MiP cases in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Despite the increasing interest devoted to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> in recent years, little is known on its impact on maternal and foetal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref001">1</xref>]. As for the clinical consequences, the economics of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria has been neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref008">8</xref>]. In Brazil, published data on the socio-economic aspects of malaria date from the nineties. At that time attention was focused on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria, which was responsible for nearly half of the outpatient cases, and associated with high fatality rates. Most studies focused either on value estimates of productive time losses due to malaria among specific group of workers, mainly miners, or on the costs and the cost-effectiveness of specific malaria control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref018">18</xref>]. Recently, attention has been dedicated to the economic evaluation of diagnostic tools for the identification of the most cost-effective strategy for malaria control in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref020">20</xref>]. So far, no published data exists on the socio-economic aspects of MiP in Brazil.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian National Health System is based on the principle of universal access to care. Malaria treatment is provided only through the National Unified Health System (SUS) and it is free to patients, implying great challenges on the public finance of healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref021">21</xref>]. Even if patients do not incur any medical costs, other costs are likely to have a relevant impact on household budgets, such as transportation and indirect costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
        <p>This study aims to describe the costs of the treatment of MiP in an endemic setting of the Brazilian Amazon both from the health system and the patient perspectives. This information may be of relevance for health policy decision-making on MiP control and it may have implications for malaria elimination in the region.</p>

        <title>Study area and population</title>
        <p>This study was carried out at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) and at the João Avelino Pereira Health Post (JAPHP) in the city of Manaus, Western Brazilian Amazon. Manaus is the most populous city of the Brazilian northern region, with about 2 million inhabitants. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Manaus is US$ 13,695, nearly 20% higher than the national average GDP per capita. Despite this good economic indicator, mainly due to the presence of natural resources in the area, Manaus has the highest poverty rates of the Metropolitan Region’s capitals of the North/Northeast of Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref022">22</xref>]. The Gini index for the year 2010 was 0.6334, pointing to high level of inequality in income distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref023">23</xref>]. The Annual Parasitic Index (API) in Manaus was of 8.87/1,000 inhabitants in 2011, being classified as a low risk malaria transmission area (less than 10 cases/1.000 inhabitants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref024">24</xref>]. In 2011, a total of 215 cases of MiP were reported in the Manaus area. Seventy percent (151/215) were reported by the FMT-HVD, and most of them (96%) were caused by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref012">12</xref>]. The FMT-HVD is the only public tertiary referral hospital for infectious diseases in the Amazonas state. The institution is a 150-bed hospital, including a passive case detection (PCD) system outpatient clinic, a day-hospital care area, and an intensive care unit. The FMT-HVD is also a referral institution for research and training. The JAPHP is a primary health care centre located in an endemic malaria area in the periphery of Manaus city responsible for 22.5% of local notification in 2010. There is no emergency care or inpatient care at the JAPHP.</p>

        <title>Study design and definitions</title>
        <p>This was a cost-of-illness study conducted in the context of the PregVax multicentre collaborative project (UE 201588), a health-facility based cohort study aimed to determine the burden and impact of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> infection in pregnancy, conducted in five endemic countries: Brazil, Guatemala, Colombia, India and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>In the current study, an outpatient malaria episode was defined as an episode that does not require hospital admission. The treatment provided for an outpatient episode is called ambulatory care. Every visit to the health facility, whether for ambulatory care or follow up, is called consultation. At the FMT-HVD, an outpatient malaria episode usually requires three consultations; a first one for diagnosis and treatment, and two additional consultations for follow-up. An inpatient malaria episode requires hospital admission for 3 days plus two follow-up consultations as outpatients after discharge.</p>
        <p>Two different approaches were taken to estimate patient and provider costs. Patients’ costs were estimated based on a survey conducted among pregnant women who presented at the FMT-HVD or at the JAPHP and receiving a diagnosis of malaria. Direct and indirect costs were estimated through data collected during the survey. Provider costs were estimated following treatment protocol for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and by accessing administrative data at the FMT-HVD.</p>

        <title>Patients’ data</title>
        <p>Pregnant and postpartum women attending the FMT-HVD or the JAPHP from January 2011 to March 2012 diagnosed with clinical malaria (due to any <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species) microscopically confirmed, were invited to participate in the study before leaving the health facility after a consultation or at discharge after admission. After written informed consent was given, women were administered with a questionnaire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s004">S1 Appendix</xref>) and personal information, time lost because of the illness, and data on costs for the treatment and prevention (use of bed net, skin repellent, insecticide) of MiP, including direct (medical and non-medical) costs incurred at the health facility were collected. At each contact with the health facility, women were asked about eventual previous treatments sought for the symptoms associated with the same malaria episode.</p>
        <p>From the patient perspective the cost of an outpatient consultation and of an admission for a malaria episode were estimated. In the case the same woman was interviewed twice the time gap between two consultations or between a consultation and an admission was observed in order to distinguish between contacts on the same episode and on a new one. The second contact with the health facility was considered as part of a new episode when the time between the first and the second interview was more than 7 days. If the time between two interviews was less than 7 days, the second one was not included in the analysis.</p>
        <p>Postpartum period was considered until six weeks after the delivery date. The place of residence for each study woman (neighbourhood) was located on digital maps and distance to the health facility was calculated linearly. Average transportation costs per unit of distance (kilometres) were estimated.</p>

        <sec id="sec010">
        <title>Providers’ data</title>
        <p>Direct medical cost data were gathered by interviewing focal staff from the Department of Health of the State of Amazonas at the municipal, state, and federal levels; as well as focal personnel from the Administration and Malaria Departments of the FMT-HVD. Additional data sources, such as the official databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health and scientific literature, were also consulted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s002">S2</xref> Tables) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>From the provider perspective, costs of an outpatient (including 3 consultations) and of an inpatient malaria episode (including 3 days admission and 2 follow-up consultations) were estimated. Direct provider costs for a malaria episode included the cost of a thick smear test, the drugs for malaria treatment (including treatment of febrile syndrome), the value of time of health staff, and the cost of food in the case of inpatients.</p>
        <p>The cost of a thick smear was assumed to be equal to the one published by Oliveira et al. adjusted for inflation according to the Consumer Price Index for 2011 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s001">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref026">26</xref>]. In Oliveira et al. the base-case estimate was taken from Macauley that considered the costs of all supplies used in a PCD system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref027">27</xref>]. Microscopes and maintenance, training and the value of time of the staff involved in the malaria diagnosis were added to Macauley’s estimates. The cost of microscopes was based on purchase costs by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Health Surveillance Foundation) in 2006, annualized based on a 5% depreciation rate and a 15-year average lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref019">19</xref>]. The cost of the annual maintenance for one microscope was provided by a supplier of the FMT-HVD. The staff costs for malaria and anemia diagnosis were based on the time allocated to perform each activity reported by the staff of the FMT-HVD. Time was estimated in 20 minutes per diagnosis performed by each staff involved, except the laboratory technician (10 minutes). Training costs was based on one annual 160 hour training for reading blood smears for malaria diagnosis and obtained from the Public Health Central laboratory of the Amazonas (LACEN).</p>
        <p>Calculation of malaria treatment costs was based on the current recommendations for case management of MiP in Brazil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The standard treatment for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria in pregnant women consists of oral chloroquine (CQ) (1500 mg, over three days) followed by weekly prophylactic regimen of CQ (300 mg, over 12 weeks). Radical treatment with primaquine is recommended six months after delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref008">8</xref>]. The recommendation for treatment of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria is quinine plus clindamycin in the first trimester and artemether-lumefantrine in the second and third trimesters. Severe <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria cases are treated as for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> cases.</p>
        <p>In addition to the malaria treatment, a haemogram was assumed to be performed in both outpatient and inpatient cases. It was assumed that at least a full blood count was performed for the malaria cases managed at the FMT-HVD (outpatient and inpatient cases) but not for those managed at the JAPHP. For <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> cases, one extra outpatient consultation was considered for radical cure six months after delivery. It was considered that malaria treatment during admission was done intravenously, and completed with antimalarials orally after discharge. Antipyretic and antiemetic drugs were considered for both outpatient and inpatient treatments, regardless of their actual use. The patients are advised to use these medications only in the presence of symptoms, not continuously. It was assumed that the acetaminophen and the metoclopramide were prescribed in the quantity of 10 tablets each for an outpatient malaria case, and that intravenous metoclopramide were prescribed over admission for an inpatient case, plus 10 tablets of acetaminophen and metoclopramide orally after discharge.</p>
        <p>The cost of antimalarial drugs was provided by the Health Surveillance Foundation, and cost for analgesics and antiemetics drugs and for parenteral solutions for intravenous treatment by the Stock Prices of the Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref028">28</xref>]. The personnel involved in malaria case management were a medical doctor for an outpatient case, plus nurse and nurse technician for an inpatient case. Reported time per consultation or per bed/day allocated to care for the each woman was 20 minutes for all professionals excluding nurse technicians (45 minutes). For inpatients, the cost spent on food, all meals (six meals/day) for the patient and for one companion was provided by a supplier of FMT-HVD.</p>
        <p>Overhead costs data were retrieved from the Administration Department of the FMT-HVD based on reports of all economic and financial costs incurred during the year 2010 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004494.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Overheads included recurrent costs such as water, energy, cleaning, laundry, kitchen, communication, transportation, and other contracted services such as legal expenses, security, maintenance and capital costs. Capital costs included vehicles, at their replacement value, and capital investments such as the construction of new buildings or the restoration of old ones within the FMT-HVD facilities undertaken between 2005 and 2010. Useful life was considered as 30 years for buildings and 10 years for vehicles.</p>

        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>All data from patients were collected through standardized questionnaires and analysed using Stata software (version 12, College Station, Texas, USA) and Microsoft Excel. The time horizon was one year and the year of analysis from the patient perspective was 2011 and from the provider perspective was 2010.</p>

        <title>Patient costs</title>
        <p>From the patient perspective, direct costs (financial costs) were broken down into medical, transportation and other costs (food, phone calls, etc). Indirect costs were calculated by multiplying reported time lost by the nominal value of the median monthly permanent income per capita of households of Manaus from Census of 2010 (US$ 237.50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref029">29</xref>]. Patient costs incurred at the FMT-HVD or at JAPHP, as well as for any treatment sought earlier for the same episode, were calculated.</p>
        <p>Due to distribution skewness, the median and the interquartile range (IQR) were used to report cost estimates, instead of mean and standard errors. Yet, mean values are also shown to provide a comprehensive description of cost distributions. Bootstrap simulation with 1000 replications was carried out to deal with the issue of distribution skewness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

        <sec id="sec013">
        <title>Provider costs</title>
        <p>From the health provider perspective, costs were estimated using a mixed approach of bottom-up and top-down costing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref032">32</xref>]. Bottom-up approach was used for treatment costs. These were calculated by multiplying the quantity of each drug by the relative unit costs plus the time spent by each professional times the respective unit wage cost.</p>
        <p>Top-down and bottom-up costing was also used to estimate the cost of a thick smear. The cost of a microscope, its maintenance and the training of a microscopist per slide examined was calculated by dividing the value of each input (considering that four microscopes and eight microscopists were the available resources for malaria diagnosis at the Malaria Diagnosis Department in the FMT-HVD) by the number of thick smears performed at the FMT-HVD in 2010 (27,257 thick smears) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref011">11</xref>]. Personnel costs, estimated through bottom-up approach, were added to these figures.</p>
        <p>Top-down costing was the approach used on overheads. On the 2010 FMT-HVD activity report, the number of basic care consultations (not involving a medical doctor), medical consultations, day hospital stays and hospital admissions were identified. To apportion overhead costs to one malaria episode as outpatient and as inpatient, all activities were expressed in terms of outpatient by assuming that a day of admission and a day hospital at the FMT-HVD correspond to 2, and a basic care consultation to half outpatient consultation, respectively. Total overheads were divided by the resulting number of outpatient-translated activities to estimate the share of overhead imputable to one outpatient consultation; this ratio was then multiplied by 2 and by 3 (average number of days for malaria inpatient) to impute overheads to an inpatient case. Overhead costs were distinguished between recurrent, such as annual general expenses, and capital costs, such as vehicles and long term investments.</p>
        <p>Costs at the JAPHP were estimated based on one microscope, one microscopist, and one clinical technician for malaria diagnosis, with the clinical technician being also the focal person for administration of malaria treatment if the thick smear was positive.</p>
        <p>Among non-overhead costs, personnel costs were considered as economic costs, while the remaining costs were considered as financial.</p>
        <p>For sensitivity analysis parameters were varied 10% above and below these base-case values. For malaria diagnosis, upper limit of variation considered Macauley’s estimates of a passive plus active case detection diagnosis scenario; lower limit was the cost estimated by Malaria Laboratory of the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

        <title>Provider total costs in Manaus</title>
        <p>Total provider cost for outpatient and inpatient MiP episodes reported at the FMT-HVD in 2010 were calculated by multiplying the unit costs of every resource used for diagnostic and treatment by the number of MiP cases. Total costs were calculated separately for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. In 2010, 135 out of the total of 364 MiP episodes reported in the Manaus area presented at the FMT-HVD, with 120 of them treated as outpatients and 15 requiring admission. One hundred of the outpatient cases were due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and 20 to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. All the 15 malaria admissions were due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>. Total costs also included malaria screening of suspected cases that resulted negative (N = 298 at the FMT-HVD in pregnant women, year 2010). Total costs of treating MiP for the whole Manaus area, not only FMT-HVD, were calculated by considering that the number of malaria cases in pregnant women reported to other health facilities in the area was 229, of which 222 cases were due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and 7 cases due to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. Costs of the 229 MiP cases were estimated based on the assumption that these were managed at primary health facilities similar to the JAPHP: costs of JAPHP were, thus, used. All costs were expressed in US$ 2011. The average exchange rate Brazilian Real/US$ of 0.57 (January 2011 –March 2012) was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref033">33</xref>].

Nearly half of the women (47%; 30/64) were between 20 and 29 years of age, and a high proportion (20%; 13/64) were adolescents (≤ 19 years old), with the youngest aged 11 years. Most women (67%; 43/64) were from the Manaus urban area, and their main activity was housework (72%; 46/64). Nearly 50% of study women (30/64) came from two metropolitan areas of the city of Manaus where the incidence of malaria is reported to be highest, namely Jorge Teixeira and Tarumã areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004494.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

        <p>The reported use of bed nets by study women was low (6%; 4/73) and 12% (9/73) reported having taken weekly chloroquine as a prevention of malaria relapse. The use of insecticides and skin repellents was reported in 26% (19/73) and 19% (14/73) of interviews, respectively. No use of malaria preventative measures was reported in nearly 40% of interviews (27/73). Bus was the transportation more frequently used (51%; 37/73) to reach the health facility, followed by car/motorbike (27%; 20/73), and taxi (7%; 5/73). Two study women travelled by boat along the Negro river. Six women enrolled at the FMT-HVD sought previous treatment at a pharmacy, while two women enrolled at the JAPHP reported having visited another health facility previously.</p>

Mean prevention costs were US$ 13.50 for an outpatient malaria consultation and US$ 3.85 for an admission. Out-of-pocket transportation median costs were US$ 10.66 (IQR, 5.33, 23.68) for a consultation and US$ 20.42 (IQR, 1.33, 51.8) for an admission. Unit cost of transportation, per km, was US$ 1.81 on average, with a median of US$ 0.66 (IQR, 0.61, 1.92). Total median costs including previous treatments sought were US$ 45.91 (IQR, 28.44, 80.41) and US$ 216.29 (IQR, 138.36, 327.07) for a consultation and an admission, respectively. The bootstrap analysis revealed that the median total costs including previous treatments sought were US$ 49.27 (IQR, 28.44, 80.41) for an outpatient consultation, and US$ 240.78 (IQR, 149.80, 393.42) for an admission. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004494.t004">Table 4</xref> shows costs incurred by the nine women who experienced two episodes of MiP during the study period.

Interestingly, all women experiencing two episodes during the study period had <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria.

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Malaria in pregnancy represents a relevant economic burden in this area of the Amazon region, despite being a low risk transmission setting where <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> predominates. The study reveals that the cost of treating malaria in pregnancy underwent a remarkable increase particularly when the patients required admission and in terms of indirect cost, and when the cost of subsequent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria episodes were considered. Patients’ costs reached up to 1.20% of the local average annual per capita income and the 3.4% when multiple episodes were taken into account. Considering that the income of pregnant women with malaria is likely to be lower than the average, these percentages may represent a lower bound of the actual economic burden to patients. From the health provider perspective, total costs for the management of all malaria cases in pregnancy in Manaus in 2010 approximately correspond to 30 times the average national government health per capita expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
        <p>Radical treatment with primaquine, the unique hypnozoitocidal drug licensed, is contraindicated in pregnancy, making pregnant women more vulnerable to one or multiple relapses throughout gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref037">37</xref>]. In addition, any malaria episode exposes pregnant women to malaria paroxysm, which threats the outcome of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref002">2</xref>]. Thus, it could be argued that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria represents a dreadful extra toll by putting the mothers, and their offsprings, repeatedly at risk. In this study, it was not possible to differentiate if the subsequent malaria episodes suffered by women within the same pregnancy were a recrudescence, a relapse or a reinfection; though each of these additional episodes translates into additional economic costs to the health system and to the women.</p>
        <p>According to study results the highest costs were incurred by women with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria, particularly when subsequent episodes were taken into account. In addition, being <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> the most prevalent species in the area, most of the costs for the treatment of MiP in the Brazilian Amazon are essentially associated with this species rather than with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>.</p>
        <p>From the patient perspective, the costs data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey. Because of not using the longitudinal data method, it did not allow to estimating the whole cost of an episode of malaria arising from the complete path of care pregnant women receive, which consists of three consultations in the outpatient case or of an admission plus two consultations after discharge in the inpatient case. Therefore, patient costs estimated in the study represent only a share of the total economic burden women bore for one episode of MiP.</p>
        <p>Study women reported low use and expenses on preventive tools. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have recently been introduced as a malaria control tool in the area and distributed for free to the population. Therefore, at the time of the study, the few pregnant women reporting bed net use were very likely to be using a non-insecticide treated net instead of ITNs. Median cost on preventive tools among women who were admitted were lower than among those who were treated as outpatients, suggesting that lower expenditure in malaria prevention may be associated with a higher risk of severe disease.</p>
        <p>Provider costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of the 135 confirmed cases of malaria in pregnant women reported by the FMT-HVD in 2010 constituted 1% of the total activities undertaken that year in the tertiary hospital. However, costs associated with MiP are higher when costs of diagnostic tests performed to the rest of women with suspicion of malaria that resulted negative are considered. These costs (US$ 1,919.12) were higher than the total provider costs for the management of all <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria cases in pregnant women in 2010 in Manaus (US$ 1,297.37).</p>
        <p>In Brazil, the recommended guidelines for MiP consist of active detection at each antenatal care visit and weekly prophylaxis with chloroquine to prevent relapses. In the current context of decreasing malaria incidence, both in the general population and in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref038">38</xref>], questions are emerging on whether active case detection may remain cost-effective. Although this study did not include these costs as the focus was on the management of MiP confirmed cases, it offers invaluable information for cost-effectiveness analysis of the most adequate strategies for malaria in pregnancy control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
        <p>From a financial point of view, an important consideration is that funding from the National Unified Health System (SUS) was insufficient to ensure adequate resources for the management of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref040">40</xref>]. Funding to the FMT-HVD comes from the Amazonas state budget and from Brazil federal budget by the SUS. The SUS refunds fixed amounts according to procedure. For example, FMT-HVD receives for a malaria outpatient consultation performed by a medical doctor the value of US$ 5.7. This value is only the 5.69% of the total estimated cost. For an inpatient case, the FMT-HVD receives from the SUS the value of US$ 130.65, which in our estimates corresponds approximately to the cost of only one bed/day [US$ 118.51 (ranging from US$ 111.64 to US$ 124.57)], thus to 1/3 of the total cost of an average three days admission. In recent years, reductions in the federal share of SUS financing have been partly balanced by increased state and municipal health spending: in 2010, the Amazonas state assigned the 12% of the state budget to health, corresponding to approximately US$ 752.4 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
        <p>The study mentioned specific aspects of healthcare services in the Amazon region, one of them being the Brazilian indigenous health system. Over the past years, the Brazilian government faced several difficulties in managing the indigenous healthcare services, and health care has been provided by different organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref041">41</xref>]. Only in 2010 with the creation of the Indigenous Health Special Secretariat (SESAI), the Ministry of Health started to directly manage the healthcare of indigenous people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref042">42</xref>]. The indigenous woman that was enrolled in the study lived in a Yanomami village within the Pico da Neblina National Park, located in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, 850 kilometers far from Manaus. She was transferred to Manaus by boat along the Negro river, a common situation in Amazonas state. A peculiarity in the access to specific health services in the Amazon region, not specific to indigenous population, is the need to travel long distances. During pregnancy, this can worsen maternal conditions, with possible negative consequences to the mother and fetus and increases costs for both patients and the health service.</p>
        <p>A few studies previously engaged with the economics of malaria in Brazil. In the 90s, the average individual costs associated with malaria in Brazilian gold mining areas represented approximately 12% of the median annual salary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref017">17</xref>]. In a mining town of the Brazilian Amazon, a programme consisting of all community members being offered free diagnosis with rapid tests and treatment with mefloquine, lead to conspicuous savings of 77% compared to passive case detection with quinine plus doxycycline, the recommended antimalarial drugs used as first line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref018">18</xref>]. The overall cost-effectiveness of another malaria control programme including both vector control and case management over a period of seven years was US$ 69 per Disability-Adjusted Life Years averted. However, case treatment was found to be more cost-effective than vector control, particularly where <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> was more prevalent than <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> and insecticide spraying was no more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref013">13</xref>]. In another study, the aggregate productivity loss because of malaria for the years 1990–1994 in the city of Manaus was estimated to be about US$ 15.000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref014">14</xref>]. More recently, malaria diagnosis with light microscopy has been found to be more cost-effective than rapid diagnostic tests even in remote areas of the Amazonian basin if the accuracy of microscopists is maintained high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004494.ref019">19</xref>]. None of these studies included data on pregnant women as a target population, nor their objectives are comparable to the ones of the present study.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study reveals the high economic burden associated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria in pregnancy in an area of low risk malaria transmission of Brazil. Especially when multiple infections are considered, costs associated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> are higher than costs associated with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. The information generated will be of help for informed-based decision making for malaria in pregnancy control and elimination strategies in the region.</p>

        <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
        <p>We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants, 132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus), and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors). IgG responses to Ebola glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader. A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive and negative controls. We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had Ebola virus disease. Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine.</p>

        <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
        <p>By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>With over 28,000 reported cases, the 2013–16 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic is the largest and longest on record. This study provides further evidence that Ebola, like other viruses, causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations that may include minimally symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that many episodes of human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa may have gone undetected in the recent outbreak. This has implications for the definition of Ebola virus disease survivorship, delineation of transmission chains, and future vaccine studies.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Despite over 28,000 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 2013–16 pandemic as of March 27, 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref001">1</xref>], we are only beginning to trace the complex biosocial processes that have promoted spread of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref003">3</xref>]. Important questions remain, including how to best use tools such as new vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref004">4</xref>] and rapid diagnostic tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref005">5</xref>] to contain future outbreaks, the extent to which symptomatic individuals do not present for care, how to identify and manage clinical sequelae of EVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref006">6</xref>], and the incidence and transmission dynamics of minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection.</p>
        <p>Evidence for minimally symptomatic EBOV infection is limited. During the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, it is not known if clinical sequelae seen in survivors of EVD (e.g., uveitis) exist in individuals who had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.</p>
        <p>In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a recognized Ebola ‘hotspot’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref011">11</xref>], which we defined as an area with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD attack rate above 2% in a two-month period.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec005" sec-type="materials|methods">
        <title>Methods and Results</title>
        <p>To measure the occurrence of EBOV infection in a group of people exposed to confirmed cases, we validated a commercial ELISA kit in a cohort of patients with known Ebola status and then used this tool to determine infection status in previously quarantined individuals.</p>
        <sec id="sec006">
        <title>Ethics Statement</title>
        <p>The study protocol was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID: 33882). We held meetings with Paramount, Sectional, and Town Chiefs to discuss the proposal and supply them with written information. We then held town meetings to describe the project and answer community questions. Individuals provided written informed consent or placed a thumbprint after hearing a consent script read in the Krio or Kono languages (both ethics committees approved the use of an oral script and thumbprint for those participants who could not read or write); parents signed for children under the age of 18, and children and adolescents provided verbal assent. Subjects received 50,000 Leones (~$10 US) for their participation in the study.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec007">
        <title>Setting</title>
        <p>Kono is a diamond-rich district in eastern Sierra Leone which reported 301 cases of EVD (that is, RT-PCR confirmed individuals who presented for isolation or were identified by surveillance teams) between August 2014 and February 2015 (Kono District Ebola Response Centre (DERC), personal communication). Several of the authors worked closely with the Kono DERC, British military, and International Federation of the Red Cross on containment, isolation, and surveillance during the time of active transmission in the district. Parts I and II of this study were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016 by a team consisting of two physicians, a physician-anthropologist, a laboratory technician, and two community health workers.</p>
        <sec id="sec008">
        <title>I. ELISA Validation</title>
        <p>We recruited 30 EVD survivors as positive controls by contacting the director of the Kono Survivors’ Group and requesting that she identify individuals interested in participating in a serosurvey. Using Kono DERC records, we verified that survivors had been admitted to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) and had a documented RT-PCR positive result for EBOV. To identify a group of people whom we considered at very low risk of previous EBOV infection to serve as negative controls, we used Kono DERC records to locate three villages in Kono District in which no Ebola cases had been reported: In the villages of Tombodu, Wardu, and Njagbwema, we recruited 132 individuals who denied contact with Ebola cases both inside and outside of their communities.</p>
        <p>We collected blood samples from participants in 4-mL EDTA BD Vacutainer tubes. The tubes were stored at 4C until arrival at the laboratory. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation (20 minutes, 1228g), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed the day of sample collection.</p>
        <p>We assessed anti-glycoprotein (anti-GP) and anti-nucleoprotein (anti-NP) responses to EBOV by means of commercial ELISA kits (AE 320620–1 and AE 320520–1, respectively) from Alpha Diagnostic International (ADI), San Antonio, TX, USA. These were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader (Awareness Technologies, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA). Values are reported in units per milliliter (U/mL) with the use of reference antibody provided by the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>To determine overall accuracies for the two ELISAs in combination and individually, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the individual and combined anti-GP and anti-NP tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref012">12</xref>]. The cutoff for a positive test was established by ROC analysis, defined as the point along the ROC curve that gave the highest sum of sensitivity (%) and specificity (%).</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005087.g001">Fig 1</xref> provides ROC curves and AUCs for the individual and combined ELISA assays. AUCs for the anti-GP, anti-NP, and combined assays were 0.992 (SE = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.983–1.000), 0.975 (SE = 0.010, 95% CI = 0.956–0.995), and 0.997 (unable to determine CIs as the combined ROC was generated through logistic regression), respectively, suggesting that these three tests were statistically equivalent. The cutoff for the anti-GP ELISA that yielded optimal sensitivity (96.7%) and specificity (97.7%) was 4.7 U/mL.</p>

        <title>II. Serosurvey</title>
        <p><italic>Study population</italic>. We conducted a serosurvey in Sukudu, a village of approximately 900 inhabitants (100 households) that was one of three major ‘hotspots’ in Kono District. We obtained a list of quarantined houses and EVD cases from the Kono DERC and verified it with the town chiefs and youth leaders. We also interviewed members of all of the affected households and discussed the identification of EVD cases with them to triangulate DERC records. We defined potential participants as having been exposed to EBOV if they stayed in a house that was quarantined based on sharing a public latrine with a confirmed case or based on a confirmed case living there. All homes were geolocated using a remotely sensed image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005087.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Between December 15, 2014 and January 14, 2015, the Kono DERC reported 34 cases of EVD in Sukudu (16 confirmed cases, 12 probable cases, and 6 survivors). Probable cases were defined as any deceased suspected case having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case.</p>
        <p>We recruited healthy children and adults age 4 and older who had been placed under quarantine during the period of active Ebola transmission in Sukudu. None of these individuals had participated in an Ebola vaccine trial. Each potential participant was screened for fever or symptoms consistent with EVD, and he/she was excluded if any were present. Medical referral to a nearby Partners In Health-supported clinic (which provides free medical care to those unable to pay) was provided.</p>
        <p>Of 193 individuals from Sukudu who were quarantined for sharing a public latrine or living quarters with a confirmed case, only 4 declined to participate. Ten individuals were initially excluded because of fever at the time of initial contact; none of these met the case definition for EVD. On reassessment one week later, all but one had defervesced and were able to provide blood samples. Two participants had failed venipuncture attempts for blood draw. We thus sampled a total of 187 individuals for anti-GP in 24 of 25 previously quarantined houses as defined above (the members of 1 quarantined household could not be located).</p>
        <p><italic>Survey</italic>. We collected the following data from study participants: age, gender, occupation, education level, whether or not they shared a room with a confirmed case of EVD, and whether they had signs or symptoms consistent with EVD that were severe enough to prompt seeking of care during the time of their village outbreak. Specifically, these included fever or unexplained bleeding or any three of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccups, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref013">13</xref>]. Other household members verified signs and symptoms.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005087.t001">Table 1</xref> shows that 57.8% of participants were male, 35.8% were less than 15 years of age, 48.6% worked outside the home (mostly as farmers or miners), and 79.1% had completed primary school or less. Among exposed participants who were quarantined, 50.2% shared a public latrine with a confirmed case, and 49.8% slept in the house of a confirmed case.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>One year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we identified positive IgG responses to Zaire-EBOV in 14 individuals not known to have had EBOV infection from a village classified as a hotspot for Ebola transmission. Of these, the majority reported having had no symptoms consistent with EVD during the epidemic while two reported only fever. Thus, we provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. In addition, our data suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the epidemic.</p>
        <p>Although it was difficult to verify symptoms through our retrospective interviews (given the considerable denial of EVD during the outbreak due to stigma and the fear of being admitted to an ETU where those admitted were seldom discharged), our data indicate that 25% of EBOV infections may have been minimally symptomatic, which is similar to the data from empiric studies and to recent modeled estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
        <p>The phenomenon of previously undetected, minimally symptomatic EBOV infection was evident around the discovery of the virus in 1976. Using an immunofluorescence assay, the World Health Organization/International Study Team found that 19% of contacts of EVD cases—very few of whom gave any history of illness—had antibodies to the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref015">15</xref>]. In 2000, Leroy and colleagues published a study (based on ELISA/Western blot) and found that of 24 asymptomatic close contacts of Gabonese patients with EVD, 11 developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola Zaire antigens, indicating viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref016">16</xref>]. Other investigators have found evidence of seropositive individuals in areas without large outbreaks using ELISA and postulate that there may have been active circulation of filovirus without apparent clinical manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref018">18</xref>]. Heffernan and colleagues also used ELISA in Gabon and found that 1% of individuals in an epidemic zone had IgG antibodies to Ebola Zaire virus, yet no history of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref019">19</xref>]. In another study in Gabon, Becquart and colleagues found a 15.3% Ebola Zaire IgG seroprevalence in 220 randomly selected villages and concluded that most of the seropositive persons identified “probably had mild or asymptomatic infection” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref020">20</xref>]; however, they used uninfected individuals in France as negative controls. We found that unexposed expatriates (not included as negative controls) had a significantly lower mean log anti-GP (M = 5.25 U/mL, SD = 0.54, N = 12) than unexposed Sierra Leoneans (M = 6.40 U/mL, SD = 1.06, N = 132) using the two-sample t-test for unequal variances, t(20.05) = 6.40, P&lt; = 0.001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005087.g003">Fig 3</xref>), potentially due to cross-reactivity of our assay with closely related pathogens circulating in the region.</p>
        <p>Our study has several possible limitations. First, if asymptomatic EBOV infection is a common occurrence, it is possible that some of the “true negatives” used for the validation of our ELISA assays could have been infected with EBOV. We did not use a microneutralization assay for comparison purposes, nor did our pool of EVD survivors represent all of the possible antibody titers in the regional population. Although the serologic assay conferred sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%, the assay protocol produced antibody titers that were considered qualitative in nature. Second, we relied on study participants and their household contacts’ memories of events that had taken place up to a year prior when we classified them as symptomatic or asymptomatic (potential recall bias); however, during the outbreak, most quarantined households were monitored daily by surveillance teams that conducted symptom screens and measured temperatures, and individuals were brought to treatment facilities for EBOV testing if they screened positive. Third, our IgG assays indicate previous infection but provide no information on when that infection took place. The 3 negative controls with positive tests either represent false positives due to cross-reactive antibodies or previously infected individuals. (We did not perform IgM ELISAs, as other investigators have demonstrated that Ebola IgM titers largely diminish within 60 to 90 days of symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref022">22</xref>].) Fourth, we did not ascertain whether there were non-quarantined individuals who had minimally symptomatic infection.</p>
        <p>Our study focused on the quarantined population of one village. Extrapolation of our findings to other villages and generalizability to the epidemic should be approached with caution. Although many of the study participants were followed by surveillance teams during the time of active EBOV transmission in their village, the timing of the possible infection cannot be known from IgG data, and it is improbable that surveillance teams followed each individual throughout the duration of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. Thus, the concern that IgG positive persons indeed had but denied symptoms cannot be excluded.</p>
        <p>Despite these limitations, our serosurvey provides a deeper perspective on EBOV transmission, and more village-level serosurveys could enhance our understanding of undetected EBOV transmission at the epidemic level. Furthermore, our findings suggest there would be value in exploring the interaction of seropositive persons and EVD cases to improve our understanding of exposure risk. As a result, we may learn more about how efforts at containment can be improved. The data also have important implications for future vaccine studies that rely on detecting antibody to EBOV. Lastly, the findings support the World Health Organization’s interim guidance on clinical care for survivors of EVD, which defines a survivor as a person:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item><p>With a confirmed positive result on RT-PCR testing for EBOV on any body fluid who subsequently recovered;</p>
        <p>And/or</p></list-item>
        <list-item><p>Who is IgM and/or IgG positive on serological testing for EVD and has not been vaccinated against EBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0005087.ref023">23</xref>].</p></list-item>
        </list>
        <p>There is ongoing discussion in West Africa over the definition of survivorship, usually specified by having a positive EBOV RT-PCR result and discharge from an ETU. Plans are underway to develop national registries and provide ID cards to such survivors, so as to delineate individuals eligible for free social and medical support services. Should the notion of survivorship be extended to all those who are IgG positive, including those who had minimally symptomatic infection or who were sick but were never tested at the time of illness? How we define a community of suffering is always problematic and should be revisited given that this definition has implications for identity, stigma, and access to social and medical services.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, by using ELISA to measure Zaire-EBOV antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.</p>

        People who take sick leave from work as a result of mental health problems
        very often report that the cause is stress-related. Although stress-related
        sick leave imposes a significant burden on individuals and economies, few
        evidence-based therapies exist to prevent sick leave in people who are experiencing
        stress-related mental health problems. The researchers carrying out this study
        wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention for stress-related
        mental health disorders amongst people who had been on sick leave for less
        than three months. The intervention involved short training sessions for primary
        health-care practitioners, during which the practitioners were taught how
        to diagnose stress-related problems; how to provide information to patients
        and encourage their recovery and active return to work; and how to give advice
        and monitor patients' recovery. The researchers carried out a cluster-randomized
        trial evaluating this training program, in which 46 primary care practitioners
        were assigned by chance to receive either the training program or to practice
        usual care. Over the course of the trial, 433 patients with elevated levels
        of distress and sick leave were included in the study, 227 of whom were treated
        by practitioners receiving the training program and 206 of whom received usual
        care. These patients were followed up for 12 months and the primary outcome
        studied in the trial was the length of sick leave taken until full return
        to work. Secondary outcome measures included patients' reports of distress,
        depression, and other symptoms as recorded using specific questionnaires.</p><p><bold>What
        the trial shows:</bold> In the trial, data on the primary outcome measure
        was available for 87% of the patients treated by practitioners receiving the
        training intervention and 84% of the patients receiving usual care. When these
        outcomes were analyzed, there was no evidence of a benefit of the training
        program on amount of sick leave taken. Over the course of the study, the severity
        of patients' self-reported symptoms fell in both groups, but there was no
        significant difference in symptom severity between the two groups of patients.
        A subgroup analysis suggested that more practitioners in the intervention
        group recognized patients as having stress-related mental health problems.
        Among the group of patients who were diagnosed as having stress-related mental
        health problems, those who were treated by practitioners in the intervention
        group seemed to return to work slightly more quickly than those in the usual
        care group. However, it is not easy to interpret the findings of this secondary
        analysis.</p><p><bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Strengths of this
        study include the procedures for cluster randomization, in which primary care
        practitioners were randomized, rather than patients. This process ensures
        that only patients assigned to the intervention arm receive the benefits of
        the intervention, and avoids “contamination” between intervention and control
        groups. A further strength includes the blinding of researchers who were collecting
        data to the intervention that each practitioner had received. The findings
        of the study, however, are difficult to interpret. No effect of the training
        intervention was found on the study's primary outcome measure; it is possible
        that the training intervention does indeed have some benefit, but the benefit
        may not have been found in this particular trial because of the inclusion
        of patients with a very wide range of problems; in addition the practitioners
        may have not had the time or ability to apply what they learnt in the training
        program.</p><p><bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Very little evidence
        exists regarding the effects of training interventions for improving care
        of patients with stress-related mental health problems. The findings of this
        trial support those of another study carried out in a primary care setting,
        which found that training interventions do not seem to reduce length of sick
        leave. However, another study carried out in an occupational health-care setting,
        in which patients included in the trial had been recognised as having stress-related
        mental disorders, did find some benefit of an intervention program.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding

        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b003\">3</xref>]. These problems cause
        a public health burden resulting in enormous personal and financial costs
        [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b004\">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020026-b007\">7</xref>]. Sick leave often lasts for a long period
        of time, and in developed countries, mental health problems are one of the
        main grounds for receiving disability benefits [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b008\">8</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b009\">9</xref>]. In up to 90% of mental
        health problems the cause is stress-related [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b004\">4</xref>–<xref

        restricted to primary care [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b009\">9</xref>].</p><p>Common
        psychopathology, as seen in primary care, often starts with failure to cope
        with personal, social, or occupational demands. The ability to cope or readjust
        is overtaxed, and this increases the probability that psychological distress
        will follow [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b011\">11</xref>–<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b013\">13</xref>]. Sick leave indicates
        a process of depleting psychological resources; the patient has stopped trying
        to cope, and gives in. When not due to more severe psychiatric conditions
        such as depressive disorder or anxiety disorder, this condition is known as
        adjustment disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
        fourth edition) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b014\">14</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b015\">15</xref>], neurasthenia (International
        Classification of Diseases, tenth revision) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b016\">16</xref>],
        or nervous breakdown. Because such patients are labelled with a number of
        inter-related terms and definitions, we use the term stress-related mental
        disorder (SMD) to indicate relevant dimensions of psychopathology that are
        subacute, but not yet chronic, and clearly related to stress. Subsequently
        to SMDs, persistent distress contributes to more severe psychopathology and
        chronic conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020026-b017\">17</xref>].</p><p>As yet, there are no evidence-based
        primary care interventions to improve functioning and to prevent long-term
        sick leave in patients with SMDs. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are not always
        aware of the potentially harmful consequences of sick leave and stress, because
        the symptoms seem to be self-limiting. Or, PCPs may be overly cautious and
        not question the continuation of sick leave nor ask the patient to make more
        effort to cope with the situation, feeling that this type of response undermines
        the mutual trust between patient and doctor [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b018\">18</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b019\">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id=\"s2\"><title>Methods</title><p>The
        present study is a cluster-randomised controlled effectiveness trial in which
        PCPs were randomised to an intervention group that was trained to deliver
        a minimal intervention for stress-related mental disorders, or to a control
        group that delivered care as usual. Distressed patients on sick leave visiting
        the practices of both PCP groups were screened, included, and followed up
        for one year [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b020\">20</xref>].
        The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center approved
        the study protocol and procedures.</p><sec id=\"s2a\"><title>Participants</title><p>We
        approached 139 PCPs in two districts where the Department of General Practice
        of the VU University Medical Center has some type of network positioned. A
        total of 46 PCPs signed informed consent, both for participating in our trial
        and for being randomised to either the intervention training or to the usual
        care (UC) group.</p><p>In order to recruit enough eligible patients, we made
        use of the computerised patient record system and approached the source population
        of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 22,740, see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-g001\">Figure
        1</xref>) by mail. The source population consisted of all primary care attenders
        (20–60 y) who visited consulting hours of the participating PCPs. PCPs excluded
        only patients with very severe psychiatric disorders (mania or psychosis),
        patients with terminal illness, or patients with an inadequate command of
        the Dutch language. The source population of attenders was asked to respond
        only if they met our criteria. Patient inclusion criteria were symptoms of
        SMD, and sick leave for no longer than three months from a paid job. Symptoms
        of SMD were measured by means of self-reported levels of distress (e.g., worrying,
        listlessness, feeling tense—see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-g002\">Figure
        2</xref>) in order to recruit patients. We approached the source population
        every one or two weeks, until a sufficient number of patients from a particular
        PCP were enrolled. Final recruitment took place by phone survey. All patients
        who had returned the questionnaire and screened positive on distress and sick
        leave were contacted. Next, the inclusion criteria on distress and sick leave
        for no longer than three months were checked again. Since there are no diagnostic
        criteria, we did not attempt to make a diagnosis of SMD. If positive, patients
        were asked for their informed consent to be included in the study and to have
        their data collected and analysed. If the patient consented, the telephonic
        baseline interview was started. This method of recruitment, unaffected by
        the PCPs' diagnostic or therapeutic behaviour, ensured that the recruited
        patients included in the intervention and control groups were comparable,
        and at least not subjected to selection bias.</p><fig id=\"pctr-0020026-g001\"

        a period of 6–10 wk, the PCPs randomised into the intervention group received
        training in the Minimal Intervention for Stress-related mental disorders with
        Sick leave (MISS). The training comprised two sessions of 3.5 h and two regular
        follow-up sessions of 2 h (total 11 h). The tutors during the training were
        the PCP who developed the intervention (BT) and an occupational physician.
        During the training, the PCPs were instructed to use specific methods of communication
        to help the patient, within three consultations on a time-contingent course,
        to achieve functional recovery. The MISS takes into account the time constraints
        under which a PCP works, as well as the position of a PCP as a generalist
        who does not have the capacity to apply highly specialised interventions.
        The necessary set of skills was clearly defined and taught to the PCPs. First,
        the PCPs were taught to <italic>diagnose an SMD,</italic> and to detect symptoms
        of depression and anxiety. They were then taught how to give <italic>information</italic>
        and promote the patient's understanding and how to emphasise the importance
        of the patient's active role with regard to successful return to work. Subsequently,
        they practised giving <italic>advice</italic> on the content of functional
        rehabilitation. Furthermore, the PCPs were taught active <italic>monitoring</italic>
        to evaluate whether the patient had made efforts to translate the (work) situation
        into a problem that could be solved. Lastly, the PCPs were instructed to consider
        <italic>referral</italic> to more specialised care in case no progress had
        been made, since the patient was not likely to benefit from more time off
        work. The PCPs in the UC group received no information or advice about the
        content of the intervention beforehand, but were offered the training at the
        end of the trial. Guidelines for PCPs are available for the treatment of depression
        [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b021\">21</xref>] and anxiety
        [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b022\">22</xref>], but not yet
        specifically for SMDs.</p><p>Actual treatment of the participating patients
        was left to the discretion of the PCPs, who were informed of a patient's participation
        only after a month. At baseline, patients were asked whether or not they had
        planned another visit to their PCP. If not, they were asked if they were considering
        another visit. The PCP was not obliged to apply the MISS or any other intervention,
        nor were the patients obliged to visit their PCP.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2c\"><title>Objectives</title><p>The
        aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of our MISS in primary care,
        which is intended to reduce sick leave and prevent chronicity of SMD symptoms
        in patients. We hypothesised that the MISS would be more effective than UC,
        particularly in patients who had been diagnosed with SMD by the PCP.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s2d\"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was duration of sick
        leave in calendar days from the first day of sick leave until full (not part-time)
        return to work, lasting for a period of at least 4 wk without partial or full
        relapse into sick leave. Patients were asked to record their days of sick
        leave, and this information was collected at baseline and after 2, 6, and
        12 mo during telephone interviews. The secondary outcome measures were self-reported
        symptoms of distress, depression, anxiety, and somatisation. These were measured
        with the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020026-b023\">23</xref>]) at baseline and at 2, 6, and 12 mo by
        mailed questionnaires. Elevated depression, anxiety, and somatisation scores

        disorder, whereas, in the absence of elevated depression, anxiety, and somatisation
        scores, an elevated distress score is indicative of an SMD. Two months after
        the baseline assessment, the PCPs in both groups were asked to fill in a structured
        questionnaire on the care provided and any diagnoses or working hypotheses
        in the past 3 mo according to their electronic medical record. All outcomes
        were measured at individual level.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2e\"><title>Sample
        Size</title><p>To estimate the required sample size, we used a method that
        takes into account potential clustering of effects within practices, the expected
        difference in outcome between intervention groups and the required power of
        the study. Sample size calculation was done with nQuery Advisor (Statistical

        A related study completed in occupational health care showed a difference

        rid=\"pctr-0020026-b024\">24</xref>], which we considered to be a relevant
        difference for our trial. Expecting a proportion still on sick leave after
        3 mo of 21% in the MISS group and 36% in the UC group, the sample size needed
        in each group was 126 (with a power of 80% at a 0.05 level two-sided log-rank
        test for equality of survival curves). Taking into account an intracluster
        correlation coefficient of 0.025 because of randomisation at physicians' level
        and seven patients per cluster, a total of 290 patients was needed. Assuming
        a dropout rate of 30% (approximately 10% at each moment of follow-up), enrolment
        of 415 patients was needed.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2f\"><title>Randomisation
        and Blinding</title><p>The PCPs were randomly allocated at four different
        recruitment moments, with block sizes of <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>n</italic>
        = 7, <italic>n</italic> = 14, and <italic>n</italic> = 15. A standard procedure
        was followed to conceal allocation: the names of the PCPs (and dummy in an
        uneven group) were put on a list in random order. Independently, a randomly
        ordered list of codes (1 = MISS, 2 = UC) was generated. These lists were brought
        together and the first PCP on the list was allocated to the group indicated
        by the first code, and so on. As a result, 24 PCPs were allocated to the MISS
        group and 22 to the UC group. After the PCPs were assigned and the MISS group
        had received 7 h of training, the patients were enrolled by screening the
        source population. Patient selection was performed by the research team, in
        order to prevent selection bias due to the MISS training. The PCPs entered
        the names and addresses of the source population, and the source population
        was given the inclusion criteria through a screening questionnaire. The research
        assistance team contacted the patients who returned the questionnaire by phone,
        gave information about the study, and was responsible for the final recruitment.
        The internal research team, responsible for the process of data collection,
        knew the study involved was a randomised controlled trial, but they had no
        information on which PCP was allocated to what condition. Patients and external
        interviewers were blinded. They were kept unaware that two different groups
        were formed, and were told that the study was about stress and sick leave.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s2g\"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness
        of the MISS compared to UC, we used Cox regression analysis in STATA 8.0 (Stata,
        <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.stata.com/stata8/\"
        xlink:type=\"simple\">http://www.stata.com/stata8/</ext-link>) with robust
        standard errors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b025\">25</xref>]
        on our primary outcome measure. Differences in duration of sick leave were
        expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding confidence intervals (95%
        confidence interval [CI]) for the MISS group, compared to the UC group. Estimates
        of the intervention effects on our secondary outcome measure were obtained
        from linear mixed models in SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"
        xlink:href=\"http://www.spss.com\" xlink:type=\"simple\">http://www.spss.com</ext-link>).</p><p>All
        analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle and
        corrected for the clustered design. The analyses were performed in several
        stages. First, baseline similarity of the two groups was examined for all
        potential confounders (age, gender, marital status, level of education) and
        baseline values of symptom scores (distress, depression, anxiety, and somatisation).
        Secondly, the unadjusted association between the groups (MISS versus UC) and
        both outcome measures were calculated. This association was then adjusted
        for each of the potential confounders separately. A forward selection procedure
        was followed to include the potential confounders. For our primary outcome
        measure this was done in order of highest change in the regression coefficient.
        Only those factors that changed the regression coefficient by more than 10%
        were considered to be confounders, and retained in the model. For our secondary
        outcome measure this was done by checking the significance of the <italic>p</italic>-values.
        Confounders were retained if they significantly contributed to the model (<italic>p</italic>
        &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Furthermore, we were interested in potential modification
        of the treatment effects by the PCPs' diagnosis of SMD, and therefore preplanned
        subgroup analyses on diagnosis in the Cox regression analysis and linear mixed
        models effect evaluation. Baseline measures of self-reported symptoms, as
        well as diagnoses from the electronic medical records were examined, so we
        were able to check for classification of patients and severity of complaints
        (inclusion is only by self-reported level of distress with sick leave). We
        added product terms for the possible effect-modifier “diagnosis” (with categories
        SMD, other mental health problems, or somatic health problems) and condition
        (MISS or UC) to the model and checked for significance of the interaction
        term (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10). If significant, we proceeded with subgroup
        analyses. Since the diagnostic behaviour of the PCPs in the MISS group might
        have been changed as a result of the training, we were aware of confounding
        by selection bias. If the MISS PCPs detected more patients with an SMD than
        their UC counterparts, they would possibly detect a significantly higher proportion
        of patients with relatively mild disorders, which in itself could explain
        any differences in the patient outcomes of the groups. Therefore, we tested
        again for confounding of the association between the intervention and the
        outcome by baseline values of symptom scores (distress, depression, anxiety,
        and somatisation).</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s3\"><title>Results</title><sec

        ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-t004\">Table 4</xref>, more PCPs in
        the MISS group recognised patients as having SMD (<italic>p</italic> = 0.068).
        These diagnosis categories showed interaction with the intervention in the
        Cox regression analysis on differences in duration of sick leave (<italic>p</italic>
        = 0.033). The PCPs' diagnosis of both SMDs and other mental health problems
        was associated with a longer median duration of sick leave, compared to the
        diagnosis of somatic health problems. <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-t005\">Table
        5</xref> shows the subgroup analyses, and among patients diagnosed with SMDs,
        time to return to work was shorter in the MISS group than in the UC group
        (unadjusted HR 1.49 [0.98–2.26], and adjusted HR 1.72 [1.18–2.51]). The HRs
        for return to work in the subgroups other mental health problems and somatic
        problems slightly favoured the UC group. However, these differences were small
        and not statistically significant. For our secondary outcome measure, severity
        of symptoms, the interaction of intervention with diagnosis showed no significant
        results, so no subgroup analyses were performed. Although the subgroup analyses
        were planned out before the trial took place, in no case can this result be
        regarded as evidence for a difference between the MISS group and UC group.</p><table-wrap

        were unable to prove our hypothesis that the MISS would be more effective
        than UC, either on our primary outcome measure nor on the secondary. The median
        number of days on sick leave before return to work was substantial in both
        groups and a considerable number of patients still scored above threshold
        on the self-reported symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms was reduced
        significantly during the 1 y follow-up.</p><p>The MISS did not show an overall
        effect in our study sample of patients with symptoms of distress on sick leave.
        Possible explanations for the failure to find an effect can be sought within
        the patients, the PCPs, and the intervention used. First of all, we shall
        discuss the patients. There might have been a problem with the inclusion criteria
        used. It is possible that we misclassified a substantial part of the patients
        because our criteria might have been much too broad at both sides of the severity
        continuum. As can be seen with the self-reported symptoms of depression, 24.0%
        in the MISS group and 28.8% in the UC group still scored above threshold level
        after one year. This substantial group of patients may have had conditions
        that were of a more chronic nature (e.g., depressive disorder) and needed
        more extensive care. The difficulty here is that relevant dimensions of psychopathology
        that are subacute, but not yet chronic, and clearly related to stress (e.g.,
        SMD), could not be distinguished in a straightforward way from more severe
        psychopathology or from an admixture of somatic and psychological symptoms.
        Nevertheless, we used only three questions on distress symptoms and one question
        on sick leave to recruit patients who had visited their PCP. We were convinced
        of the importance of undertaking this study, and for that reason might have
        underestimated the challenge of diagnosing SMDs. Thus, it is clear that the
        evidence base on criteria for the diagnosis of SMD in patients has to grow
        substantially.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of effect might be due to the PCPs.
        They are the gatekeepers of health care and have extensive workloads. The
        MISS takes into account the time constraints under which a PCP works, as well
        as the position of a PCP as a generalist who does not have the capacity to
        apply highly specialised interventions. Nevertheless, the PCPs may have been
        too busy to carry out any intervention at all. Alternatively, the intervention
        might have been too minimal, or the training hours too short for the PCPs
        to actually learn the necessary skills. Unfortunately, except for detection
        and labelling of symptoms, the extent to which the PCPs actually applied their
        skills was not addressed in this study.</p><p>Ancillary analyses showed there
        was an interaction between the intervention and detection of SMDs, other mental
        health problems, or somatic problems. Both SMDs and other mental health problems
        were more frequently diagnosed by the PCPs in the MISS group than by the PCPs
        in the UC group. Since, as a result of the training, the MISS PCPs were more
        sensitive to mental disorders and more keen to diagnose SMDs in particular,
        it seems logical to expect that this result would be biased. It seems likely
        that the SMD patients in the MISS group were significantly less severely affected
        than the SMD patients in the UC group. This in turn could have caused differences
        in outcome of the SMD patients in the study group, giving a false (confounded)
        impression of the effect of the MISS. However, the SMD patients in the MISS
        group actually turned out to have higher baseline levels of symptoms than
        the SMD patients in the UC group (see <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020026-st001\">Table S1</xref>). We tested baseline variables
        for confounding and as a result controlled for severity of symptoms, but that
        did not make the effect of the intervention in the SMD patients disappear.
        Nevertheless, it should be noted that this was an ancillary analysis, and
        because of the selection of the SMD patients by the PCPs' diagnosis, although
        it was a preplanned subgroup analysis, in no case can this result be regarded
        as evidence of a difference between the MISS group and UC group.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s4b\"><title>Generalisability</title><p>We carried out a randomised controlled
        trial with only a few exclusion criteria and thereby allowed considerable
        variation due to context, diagnosis, and treatment, so flattering performances
        or overestimation of application are unlikely to be issues. Instead, this
        considerable variation increases the relevance of our results because it reflects
        routine clinical practice instead of ideal circumstances.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4c\"><title>Overall
        Evidence</title><p>As far as we know, this is the first randomised controlled
        trial to evaluate the effects of an intervention in primary care for SMDs
        with sick leave as a primary outcome. At the start of our study, the only
        comparable study had been performed in occupational health care by Jac van
        der Klink et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020026-b024\">24</xref>],
        who reported high return-to-work rates after three months (78% in the intervention
        group and 63% in the UC group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). In our study, these
        rates were lower (51% in the MISS group and 57% in the UC group, <italic>p</italic>
        = 0.239). In the meantime, the results of one other randomised controlled
        trial performed in primary care have been published [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020026-b001\">1</xref>]. In that trial, social workers were trained
        to apply the intervention, while PCPs provided UC for patients in the other
        group. The study found no differences between the conditions. Return-to-work
        rates after three months were 37% in the intervention group and 40% in the
        UC group. The more favourable outcomes of this study seem to indicate that
        the occupational setting may be exceptional, and that the results may not
        equally apply to primary care. Moreover, our trial addressed a wider range
        of patients than the trial of van der Klink et al., who excluded patients
        with major depression or anxiety. The more beneficial effects of the MISS
        among patients with a PCP's diagnosis of SMD may indicate that these patients
        more strongly resemble the participants in the occupational study.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s4d\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This project represents a further
        step in the development of an evidence-based intervention for the treatment
        of distressed patients on sick leave. We were unable to show an effect of
        the MISS on duration of sick leave. In subgroup analyses a possible direction
        for further research was identified: namely, whether patients diagnosed with
        SMDs may benefit from an effect of the MISS on duration of sick leave. We
        feel that emphasis on functional rehabilitation of the patient is important,
        because continuation of sick leave may lead to chronicity and deterioration
        of symptoms. Unfortunately, diagnosis of SMD in primary health care turns
        out to be less straightforward than we expected, and the evidence base on
        criteria for this diagnosis will need to grow substantially before definite
        conclusions can be drawn. Researchers should take into account the importance
        of a diagnostic work-up to differentiate between common mental health problems,
        because there is still a lack of generally accepted criteria to diagnose “uncomplicated
        SMD” as a level of psychopathology.</p><p>Furthermore, continuing research
        should focus on the potential beneficial effects of the MISS; we need to investigate
        which elements of the intervention might be useful and which elements should
        be adjusted to make the MISS effective.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s5\"><title>Supporting

        The burden of death and disease caused by malaria is very high, particularly
        amongst young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Many African countries have
        adopted combinations of drugs for first-line malaria treatment that include
        a compound based on the plant-derived molecule artemisinin. In Uganda, the
        artemisinin-based compound therapy (ACT) adopted as first-line therapy is
        artemether-lumefantrine (AL). However, there are limitations to the use of
        this drug; dosing is not convenient and it needs to be given with fatty food.
        There are also concerns that even though AL and other ACTs successfully treat
        the initial infection, there is a risk of malaria recurring soon after therapy,
        particularly in areas where mosquito attack rates are high. Therefore, the
        researchers here wanted to compare AL treatment with another ACT, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
        (DP), for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children who live in an area
        of Uganda where malaria is transmitted at a very high rate.</p><p><bold>What
        the trial shows:</bold> 421 children aged between six months and ten years
        arriving at a local health centre with uncomplicated malaria were recruited
        into the study. The children were randomly assigned to receive either AL tablets,
        given twice daily for 3 days, or DP tablets, given once daily for 3 days.
        The primary outcomes in the trial were the risks of clinical malaria recurring,
        and the risk of parasites reappearing in the blood but without any sign of
        clinical malaria, over 42 days of follow-up. The researchers also carried
        out tests to distinguish new malaria infections from a reappearance of the
        old infection.</p><p>Overall, children who received DP treatment were less
        likely to have malaria parasites reappear in their blood than children who
        received AL treatment. Similarly, the risk of a recurrence of clinical malaria
        was lower in the DP arm than in the AL arm; 39% of patients treated with AL
        went on to develop malaria symptoms by 42 days whilst only 25% of patients
        treated with DP did. These findings were similar if the researchers only looked
        at children in whom the same infection reappeared, as opposed to those who
        experienced a completely new infection. There did not seem to be any differences
        between the study groups in overall rates of adverse events, most of which
        were mild or moderate in nature. The serious adverse events that occurred
        in this trial were not thought to be related to the drugs being studied.</p><p><bold>Strengths
        and limitations:</bold> This trial recruited enough participants to test whether
        there were any differences in efficacy between the two treatments studied,
        and randomization procedures and blinding of study physicians were appropriate.
        A further strength is the follow-up period of 42 days, in line with recent
        World Health Organization guidelines for such trials. This trial included
        children aged under 10 years, whereas children aged under 5 years are generally
        considered most at risk from malaria. However, the majority of children in
        this trial were in the under-5 age group, and the overall results were similar
        when only considering children in this age range. Finally, one possible limitation
        is that blinding of participants may not have been complete in this trial:
        children and parents were not informed of their treatment assignment, but
        the study drugs were different in appearance.</p><p><bold>Contribution to
        the evidence:</bold> Studies from South-East Asia have indicated that DP has
        efficacy in treating malaria resistant to other drugs. However, little data
        exists regarding the efficacy and safety of DP in Africa. This trial adds
        important safety data for DP in African children, and also provides evidence
        that DP could be considered as an alternative treatment to AL, the current
        first-line therapy in many African countries.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This

        id=\"s1\"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Africa, treatment of uncomplicated
        malaria is undergoing dramatic changes. In response to widespread resistance
        of the parasite to commonly used monotherapies, particularly chloroquine (CQ)
        and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), many countries have recently adopted artemisinin-based
        combination therapy (ACT) as a first-line regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated
        malaria [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b001\">1</xref>]. In Uganda,
        artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was chosen to replace the combination of CQ +
        SP as the first-line regimen for malaria in 2004, with amodiaquine + artesunate
        (AQ + AS) offered as an alternative regimen. Although data on AL were limited
        at that time, subsequent studies from Uganda [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b002\">2</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b003\">3</xref>] and elsewhere in Africa
        [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b004\">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b006\">6</xref>] showed that AL was highly efficacious
        and well tolerated for uncomplicated malaria. Indeed, in the two published
        studies of AL from Uganda the risk of treatment failure due to recrudescence
        was reported to be less than 2% [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b002\">2</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b003\">3</xref>]. However, despite the
        promise of AL, there are substantial limitations to this regimen, including
        twice-daily dosing and need for administration with fatty food.</p><p>A concern
        with all antimalarial regimens, particularly in areas of high transmission,
        is frequent recurrence of malaria after therapy. This concern was highlighted
        in a recent study comparing efficacies of the ACTs AL and AQ + AS in Tororo,
        Uganda, an area with very high malaria transmission [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b003\">3</xref>]. In that study, both regimens were highly
        efficacious for eradication of infections but risks of reinfection were extremely
        high, with 50% of AL-treated and 66% of AQ + AS–treated patients developing
        recurrent parasitemia within 28 d.</p><p>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
        is a fixed-dose ACT that has recently become available in Africa. In studies
        from Southeast Asia, DP appeared to be well tolerated and highly efficacious
        against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b007\">7</xref>–<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b011\">11</xref>]. However, the epidemiology
        of malaria and patterns of antimalarial drug use are quite different in Africa
        than in Asia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b012\">12</xref>,<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b013\">13</xref>]. In the only published
        study evaluating DP in Africa, DP was highly efficacious with a good safety
        and tolerability profile at three sites in Rwanda [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b014\">14</xref>]. To compare the performance of DP with
        the new first-line therapy in Uganda, we conducted a randomized clinical trial
        comparing the efficacy and safety of AL and DP for the treatment of uncomplicated
        falciparum malaria in Apac, an area of extremely high transmission intensity.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s2\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"s2a\"><title>Study Site</title><p>The
        study was conducted at Aduku Health Centre, Apac District, Uganda. The district
        experiences perennial holoendemic malaria. The entomological inoculation rate
        in Apac, a measure of transmission intensity, was measured at 1,564 infectious
        bites per person per year [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b015\">15</xref>].
        The study protocol was approved by the Makerere University Research and Ethics
        Committee, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, and the
        University of California San Francisco Committee for Human Research.</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s2b\"><title>Participants</title><p>Consecutive patients presenting to
        the health center with symptoms suggestive of malaria and a positive screening
        thick blood smear were referred to study physicians for further assessment.
        Patients were enrolled if they fulfilled the following selection criteria:
        (1) age 6 mo to 10 y; (2) weight ≥ 5 kg; (3) history of fever in the last
        24 h or axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 °C; (4) no history of serious side effects
        to study medications; (5) no evidence of a concomitant febrile illness; (6)
        provision of informed consent by a parent or guardian; (7) no danger signs
        or evidence of severe malaria; and (8) <named-content content-type=\"genus-species\"
        xlink:type=\"simple\">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> monoinfection
        with parasite density 2,000–200,000/μl of blood. Because laboratory results
        were generally not available until the following day, a patient could be excluded
        after randomization.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2c\"><title>Procedures</title><p>At
        enrollment, we asked children's parents or guardians about prior antimalarial
        therapy, use of other medications, and presence of common symptoms. Axillary
        temperature and weight were measured, and a physical examination was performed.
        A brief neurological assessment, consisting of simple clinical tests for fine
        finger dexterity (ability to pick up a small object), was undertaken. We also
        obtained blood by fingerprick for thick and thin blood smears, for hemoglobin
        assessment, and to store on filter paper for molecular analysis.</p><p>Patients
        were asked to return for follow-up on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and
        42, and any other day that they felt ill. Follow-up evaluation consisted of
        a standardized history and physical examination, including neurological assessment
        on all days of follow-up. We obtained blood by fingerprick for thick blood
        smears and storage on filter paper on all follow-up days except day 1. Hemoglobin
        measurement was repeated on day 42 or the day of recurrent symptomatic malaria.
        If patients did not return for follow-up, they were visited at home.</p><p>Blood
        smears were stained with 2% Giemsa for 30 min. Parasite densities were determined
        from thick blood smears by counting the number of asexual parasites per 200
        white blood cells (WBCs), or per 500 if the count was less than 10 parasites/200
        WBCs, assuming a WBC count of 8,000/μl. A smear was considered negative if
        no parasites were seen after review of 100 high-power fields. We also assessed
        gametocytemia from thick blood smears. Thin blood smears were reviewed for
        non-falciparum infections. A second microscopist, who was unaware of the results
        of the first reading, re-read all slides. A third microscopist unaware of
        the first two readings resolved discrepant slides. Hemoglobin measurements
        were made using a portable spectrophotometer (HemoCue, <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"
        xlink:href=\"http://www.hemocue.com\" xlink:type=\"simple\">http://www.hemocue.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec
        id=\"s2d\"><title>Interventions</title><p>On day 0, patients were randomly
        assigned to receive AL or DP. A nurse administered study medications according
        to weight-based guidelines for administration of fractions of tablets. We
        administered all drugs orally as follows: AL (Coartem, Novartis, 20 mg artemether/120
        mg lumefantrine tablets), administered according to weight as one (5–14 kg),
        two (15–24 kg), three (25–34 kg), or four (≥ 35 kg) tablets given twice daily
        for 3 d; DP (Duocotexin, Holley Pharm, 40 mg dihydroartemisinin/320 mg piperaquine
        tablets), targeting a total dose of 6.4 and 51.2 mg/kg of dihydroartemisinin
        and piperaquine, respectively, given in three equally divided daily doses
        to the nearest quarter tablet. We used a pill cutter to ensure that the tablet
        fractions were as close to the nearest quarter tablet as possible. Participants
        in the DP group also received placebo tablets administered in the evening
        over 3 d to simulate the AL dosing schedule. Study medications were administered
        with water, and patients were given a glass of milk after each dose of study

        site in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2f\"><title>Outcomes: Efficacy</title><p>Treatment
        outcomes were classified according to 2006 World Health Organization (WHO)
        guidelines as early treatment failure (ETF; danger signs or complicated malaria
        or failure to adequately respond to therapy days 0–3); late clinical failure
        (LCF; danger signs or complicated malaria or fever and parasitemia on days
        4–42 without previously meeting criteria for ETF or LPF); late parasitological
        failure (LPF; asymptomatic parasitemia days 7–42 without previously meeting
        criteria for ETF or LCF); or adequate clinical and parasitological response
        (absence of parasitemia on day 42 without previously meeting criteria for
        ETF, LCF, or LPF) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b016\">16</xref>].
        Patients were treated with quinine sulfate (10 mg/kg three times daily for
        7 d) on the day that they fulfilled criteria for early treatment failure or
        late clinical failure. Patients with late parasitological failure were followed,
        and were given quinine only if they developed fever with parasitemia or remained
        parasitemic on the last day of follow-up. Patients were excluded from further
        follow-up after enrollment if any of the following occurred: (1) use of antimalarial
        drugs outside of the study protocol; (2) withdrawal of consent; (3) loss to
        follow-up; (4) protocol violation; or (5) death due to a nonmalarial illness.</p><p>The
        primary efficacy outcomes were the 28- and 42-d risks of early treatment failure
        or recurrent parasitemia (LCF or LPF), unadjusted and adjusted by genotyping.
        Secondary efficacy outcomes included prevalence of fever and parasitemia during
        the first 3 d of follow-up, change in mean hemoglobin from day 0 to day 42
        or day of repeat therapy, and prevalence of gametocytemia (presence of gametocytes
        on thick smears) during follow-up in participants lacking gametocytes at enrollment.</p><p>Molecular
        genotyping techniques were used to distinguish recrudescent from new infections
        for all patients with LCF or LPF response. Briefly, parasite DNA was isolated
        from filter paper blood samples collected at enrollment and on the day of
        recurrent parasitemia using chelex extraction. Paired samples were genotyped
        in a stepwise fashion using <italic>merozoite surface protein (msp)-2, msp-1,</italic>
        and four microsatellites [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b017\">17</xref>].
        If, for any of the six loci, an allele was not shared between day 0 and day
        of recurrence, the infection was classified as a new infection. If at least
        one allele was shared between day 0 and day of recurrence at all six loci,
        the infection was classified as a possible recrudescence. The term “possible
        recrudescence” was used because the complexity of infection (number of infecting
        parasite strains) was very high in our setting, making it difficult to distinguish
        definitively a true recrudescence from a new infection.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2g\"><title>Outcomes:
        Safety</title><p>Secondary safety outcomes included risks of serious adverse

        to the study medications [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b018\">18</xref>].
        At each follow-up visit, patients were assessed for any new or worsening event.
        All events were graded by severity (none, mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening)
        and relationship to study treatment (none, unlikely, possible, probable, or
        definite) using guidelines from the World Health Organization (Toxicity Grading
        Scale for Determining the Severity of Adverse Events) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"

        Tables, May 2001) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b020\">20</xref>].
        A serious adverse event was defined as any adverse experience that resulted
        in death, life-threatening experience, inpatient hospitalization, persistent
        or significant disability or incapacity, or specific medical or surgical intervention
        to prevent serious outcome.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2h\"><title>Sample Size</title><p>We

        d was estimated to be 50% after treatment with AL [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"

        to therapy but not enrolled in the study due to laboratory results available
        on day 1 were not included in the analysis. Risks of recurrent parasitemia
        at 28 and 42 d of follow-up (adjusted and unadjusted by genotyping) were estimated
        using the Kaplan-Meier product limit formula. Data were censored for patients
        who did not complete follow-up and for new infections when estimating outcomes
        adjusted by genotyping. Patients with LCF or LPF due to non-falciparum species

        drugs were well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate severity
        and consistent with symptoms due to malaria. Overall, there was no difference
        in the proportion of study participants who experienced any adverse event
        of moderate or greater severity between the DP (46%) and AL (42%) treatment
        groups (<italic>p</italic> = 0.47). There was also no difference in the proportion
        of patients who experienced common adverse events of any severity (<xref ref-type=\"table\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-t004\">Table 4</xref>). Serious adverse events occurred
        in six participants and included three febrile convulsions, one case of acute
        otitis media, one acute asthma attack, and one case of pyomyositis. All serious
        adverse events were judged to be unrelated to study medications. No patients
        were withdrawn from the trial for drug-induced vomiting that would have required
        alternative treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s4\"><title>Discussion</title><sec
        id=\"s4a\"><title>Interpretation</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial,
        AL and DP were both highly efficacious at initial clearance of parasitemia
        and well tolerated for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Apac, Uganda,
        an area with extremely high malaria transmission intensity. Importantly, DP-treated
        patients had a significantly lower risk of recurrent parasitemia in both falciparum
        and non-falciparum infections. Accurate distinction between recrudescent and
        new falciparum infections following therapy was challenging due to the complexity
        of infection in this high transmission setting, despite the use of 6-locus
        genotyping. However, DP clearly offered better post-treatment prophylactic
        effect following therapy compared to AL and our data suggest a reduced risk
        of treatment failure due to recrudescent parasites. DP also offered other
        benefits, including a lower risk of gametocytemia after therapy and better
        hemoglobin recovery.</p><p>The significantly lower risk of recurrent parasitemia
        after treatment with DP compared to AL is likely explained by differences
        in the terminal elimination half-lives of the two partner drugs. Piperaquine,
        a bisquinoline, is estimated to have an elimination half-life of 2–3 wk [<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b021\">21</xref>] compared to lumefantrine,
        a quinoline, which has an estimated elimination half-life of 4–10 d [<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b022\">22</xref>]. Selecting the ideal
        partner drug to combine with artemisinins in ACT regimens remains a challenge.
        Extended elimination half-lives may provide better post-treatment prophylaxis,
        but may also increase the risk for the selection of drug-resistant parasites,
        especially in areas of intense malaria transmission [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b023\">23</xref>]. Resistance may develop to partner drugs
        during the elimination phase of the drug (due to their longer half-life),
        when newly infecting parasites are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of the
        drug. As ACT use becomes widespread in areas with high levels of malaria transmission,
        it will be important to monitor closely for the selection of parasites that
        are resistant to artemisinin partner drugs, since the benefits of a regimen
        that offers decreased recurrent infection must be balanced with the consequences
        of increased selection of resistant parasites.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4b\"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Our
        study was conducted in an area of very high malaria transmission and highlights
        the importance of level of transmission in determining the overall efficacy
        of an antimalarial treatment regimen [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b024\">24</xref>].
        In a high-transmission setting, differences in the post-treatment prophylactic
        effect of ACTs may have a significant impact on the timing and frequency of
        recurrent episodes of malaria, as seen in this study. In areas with lower
        transmission intensity, a drug's post-treatment prophylactic effect would
        be expected to be of lesser importance. This is illustrated in a study from
        three sites in Rwanda with differing transmission intensity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b014\">14</xref>]. At a periurban site with relatively
        low transmission intensity, the risk of recurrent parasitemia after 28 d was
        equally low in patients treated with DP (4%) and patients treated with AQ
        + AS (7%). In contrast, at two rural sites with high transmission intensity,
        the risk of recurrent parasitemia was significantly lower with DP (12%) compared
        to AQ + AS (23%).</p><p>One limitation of this study was the difficulty of
        accurately distinguishing recrudescence from new infections among patients
        with recurrent parasitemia, due to the high complexity of infection. Among
        episodes classified as “possible recrudescence,” the mean complexity of infection
        was over five clones on day 0 and approximately four clones on the day of
        recurrent parasitemia. Even using six-locus genotyping, the probability of
        a new infection being misclassified as a recrudescence may be relatively high.
        Thus, the reported 42-d risks of recurrent parasitemia adjusted by genotyping
        of 16% in the AL treatment arm and 6.9% in the DP treatment arm likely overestimate
        the true risks of recrudescence.</p><p>In this study we followed the new WHO
        outcome classification system where a patient is classified as a failure after
        the first reappearance of parasitemia, regardless of whether the patient is
        symptomatic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b016\">16</xref>].
        Previously, patients with asymptomatic parasitemia following therapy were
        distinguished from those with recurrent symptomatic malaria based on the assumption
        that asymptomatic parasitemia may not be clinically important in areas of
        high transmission intensity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b025\">25</xref>].
        However, in this study, where semi-immunity is expected to be high, the vast
        majority of patients with asymptomatic parasitemia following therapy went
        on to develop symptomatic malaria, strongly supporting the new WHO protocol
        recommendations and suggesting the weakness of natural immunity in clearing
        these parasites.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4c\"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>In
        this study, DP was shown to offer benefits over AL, including lower risks
        of recurrent parasitemia and gametocytemia following therapy and improved
        hemoglobin recovery. Both DP and AL are fixed-dose coformulated ACTs. However,
        DP has a simpler, once-daily dosing schedule compared to AL, which is provided
        twice daily, ideally with a fatty meal. Our results could have important policy
        implications. Currently AL is the recommended first-line therapy for treatment
        of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda, with AQ + AS recommended as an alternative
        if AL is not available. DP is now registered for use in Uganda, and appears
        to offer an additional highly efficacious ACT for our limited antimalarial
        armamentarium. In studies from Southeast Asia, DP appears to be well tolerated
        and highly efficacious against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria [<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b007\">7</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pctr-0020020-b011\">11</xref>]. In the only published study evaluating
        DP in Africa, DP had a cure rate of over 95% and had a significantly lower
        risk of recurrent parasitemia and adverse events compared to AQ + AS and AQ
        + SP in Rwanda [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b014\">14</xref>].
        Based on available data, DP warrants serious consideration as a first-line
        therapy for uncomplicated malaria in Africa. DP may also have a role for presumptive
        treatment of fever through the program for home-based management of fever
        (HBMF). Currently prepackaged CQ + SP (Homapak) is being distributed in the
        HBMF program. However, the CQ + SP combination is no longer efficacious [<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b024\">24</xref>], and there are plans
        to incorporate ACTs in the future. Use of DP for HBMF might be attractive
        because of its simple dosing schedule. There are also potential advantages
        of having more than one first-line therapy, one for facility-based management
        of malaria and another for HBMF, in reducing the selective pressure of using
        one ACT.</p><p>Despite the excellent initial parasite clearance of both ACT
        regimens in this study and the provision of ITNs at enrollment, approximately
        half of all participants experienced recurrent parasitemia within 42 d. This
        finding emphasizes the need for more aggressive approaches to malaria control
        in areas with very high malaria transmission. A study done in an area of South
        Africa with lower-intensity transmission found that the combination of vector
        control measures including indoor residual spraying and provision of AL dramatically
        decreased the malaria burden [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pctr-0020020-b026\">26</xref>].
        In order to reduce new malaria infections in our study population, we anticipate
        that combining several malaria control measures, including treatment with
        ACTs, provision of ITNs (with education about their use), and potential use
        of indoor residual spraying, as in South Africa, will likely decrease the
        malaria burden and reduce drug pressure due to repeated use of ACTs. Monitoring
        of the impact of these combined control measures will be critical to assess
        our success in malaria control in Uganda.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s5\"><title>Supporting
